## PHASE 1: SALES / DISCOVERY

**Transcript:** 20250428-160226_Jake-Kessenich.txt  
**Duration:** 30 minutes  
**Participants:** Jake Kessenich, Jordan

### Lead Source
- **Inbound** - referred by Jake Klaus
- Client reached out to GrowthCommunity
- Already had successful community ($75K/month)

### Current State (Discovery)
- **Revenue:** $75K/month (500 members)
- **Pricing:** $180/month (grandfathered members at $60)
- **Platform:** Circle (implied)
- **Team:** 2-person core (Jason + Jake), + paid facilitators
- **Structure:**
  - 5 thought leaders ($1K/month each, 1 hour monthly session)
  - 2 squad leaders ($1.5K/month - Jake + Rebecca, managing ~60-70 firms each)
  - 12 pod facilitators ($150/month, running 23 6-month masterminds)
- **Engagement:** 78% active in last 30 days (world-class)

### Pain Points Identified
1. **Admin burden** - Jake doing 12 one-on-one onboarding calls per week (30 min each = 6 hours/week)
2. **Scaling concern** - "If Jason promotes it, we'll break it"
3. **Foundation gaps** - Onboarding, tagging, segmentation needs automation
4. **Growth constraint** - Not promoting because infrastructure isn't ready
5. **Quality vs. scale tension** - Want to maintain intimacy while growing
6. **Team efficiency** - Using expensive CPAs for tasks that don't require CPA expertise

### Goals / Desired Outcomes
1. **Revenue priority** - Community = most valuable dollars (doesn't require Jason's time)
2. **Maintain vibe** - Keep intimacy, not a "Jason fan club"
3. **Scale infrastructure** - Ready for 100+ signups/week when Jason promotes
4. **Target growth** - 500 → 750-1000 members with Jason's existing audience
5. **Annual pricing** - Convert monthly subscribers to annual

### Jordan's Discovery Questions (in order)
1. "What was the main motivation behind reaching out?"
2. "Is everyone on a monthly subscription?"
3. "Are you paying those people [leaders] or volunteering?"
4. "What would you say your biggest goals are?"
5. "Is this scale fast and sell in 12 months, or get to $200K/month?"
6. "What would be some of the biggest challenges or question marks you'd want to immediately tackle?"
7. "Does it sound like alignment with what you're looking for - budget, timeline?"

### Jordan's Positioning
- **Offer:** "Specialized consulting agency - strategy AND execution"
- **Service:** "Community as a service"
- **Social proof:** Exit Five / Dave Gerhardt (similar B2B thought leader community)
- **Demo:** Showed Exit Five example in real-time (visual proof, not just talk)

### Quick Wins Identified
1. Group onboarding calls (vs. 1-on-1)
2. Entry/exit surveys (attribution + churn insights)
3. Annual subscription conversions
4. Automation for tagging/segmentation
5. Productized onboarding process

### Budget / Timeline
- **Budget:** "Budget is fine, we're investing in this"
- **Timeline:** Not explicitly discussed
- **Key concern:** Want human expert, NOT just AI/bots/automation

### The Close
- **Jordan:** "We can help with all of that... those are quick hits with immediate ROI"
- **Jake:** "Budget is fine... main concern is we want human expert element"
- **Jordan:** "We're in alignment. Let's set up more time to chat."
- **Next step:** Monday follow-up call booked
