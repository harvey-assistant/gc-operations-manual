## 🎯 THE KICKOFF SEQUENCE (60-90 minutes)

### 1. RAPPORT & CONTEXT (5-10 min)
**Purpose:** Reconnect, celebrate getting started, set excited tone

**Script examples (from actual kickoffs):**
- "So it's exciting. We're finally doing this thing. We've been talking about it for a while." (Realize)
- "Excited to finally make this official, kick things off and start day one of our [goal] journey." (Austin)

**Key elements:**
- Acknowledge the milestone (they signed!)
- Express confidence ("I'm confident we're going to get there")
- Light personal connection (dogs, kids, quick catch-up)

---

### 2. SET EXPECTATIONS (10 min)
**Purpose:** Orient them to the journey, partnership model, and how you work

**What to cover:**
- **Partnership philosophy:** "We're thought partners with you, a growth partner"
- **Our role:** "Help you see things that are hard to see because you're inside the jar"
- **Our strength:** "Proven models from working inside tons of different thought leader businesses"
- **Where we'll help:** Offer side, technology/systems side
- **How we work:** Iterative (10% → 50% → 99% clarity over time)

**Real example (Austin Cohen kickoff):**
> "This is something that is going to grow and evolve and change over time, and our goal is to be a thought partner with you, a growth partner, help you see things that are hard for you to see because you're the expert, you're inside the jar, and it's hard to read your own label when you're on the inside. But we can come in with fresh outside perspective, as well as the perspective that we have working inside of tons of different thought leader businesses. And so bringing in those proven models..."

---

### 3. REVIEW INTAKE FORM (15-20 min)
**Purpose:** Go through their responses, ask clarifying questions, fill gaps

**Process:**
- Pull up intake form on screen
- Go through section by section
- Ask follow-up questions
- Capture verbatim language they use
- Note any surprises or mismatches from discovery

**What to listen for:**
- Goals (revenue, impact, timeline)
- Current state (what's working, what's broken)
- Resources (team, content, audience size)
- Constraints (time, budget, technical)

---

### 4. DEFINE SUCCESS CRITERIA (10 min)
**Purpose:** Get crystal clear on what "winning" looks like

**Questions to ask:**
- "What would make this a massive success 6 months from now?"
- "What are the top 3 priorities you want us to tackle first?"
- "What would you be celebrating if everything went perfectly?"
- "What metrics matter most to you?"

**Capture:**
- North Star goals
- Key dates/events (launches, conferences, milestones)
- Revenue targets
- Member/engagement goals

**Real example (Austin Cohen):**
> Austin mentioned Growth Summit (Feb 5) as his "Mecca event" - 75 chiropractors, major opportunity to sell
> Jordan captured this as North Star goal and timeline anchor

---

### 5. PRESENT INITIAL DIRECTION (20-30 min)
**Purpose:** Show them you've already been thinking, give them something to react to

**Jordan's approach: "10% Plan"**
- Take liberties and come with ideas
- "I've already moved the ball forward"
- Give them something to react to vs. blank page
- "You might be like, no, I don't like any of that. Great. Now we have a faster, easier way for us to edit and refine than starting from scratch."

**What to present:**
- Initial thoughts on their offer
- Possible positioning angles
- Quick wins you see
- Rough roadmap/timeline
- Examples from similar clients

**Key principle:**
- React and refine > start from scratch
- Show you understand their situation
- Demonstrate expertise by having direction
- Make them feel like you're already working

---

### 6. ESTABLISH CADENCE & NEXT STEPS (5-10 min)
**Purpose:** Set rhythm, create momentum, book next meeting

**What to establish:**
- **Weekly sync cadence** (60 min calls, what day/time)
- **Communication channel** (email, Slack, etc.)
- **Who's on the team** (introduce Filip/Shannon if not on call)
- **Next meeting** (book it now, within 1 week)
- **Homework/deliverables** (what they need to provide, what you'll prepare)

**Real example structure:**
- Week 1-2: Strategy brief, rough 90-day plan (10% clarity)
- Week 3-4: Deep dives on offer (50% clarity)
- Week 5-6: Customer validation, finalize plan (99% clarity)

---

## 🔑 KEY FRAMEWORKS & METHODOLOGIES

### Iterative Clarity Model (10% → 50% → 99%)

**Concept:** Don't try to have everything figured out on day 1

**10% Clear Plan (Week 1):**
- Initial direction based on intake + discovery
- Rough ideas to react to
- Identify obvious quick wins
- Set priorities for next 2 weeks

**50% Clear Plan (Week 2-3):**
- Deeper dives on offer/positioning
- Customer validation starting
- Refine based on feedback
- Clearer roadmap emerging

**99% Clear Plan (Week 4-6):**
- Customer research complete
- Final offer locked
- Detailed 90-day plan
- Confidence to execute

**Why this works:**
- Reduces overwhelm
- Creates momentum fast
- Allows for course correction
- Builds confidence through iteration

---

### Handoff trigger:

## 🎬 ADDITIONAL REAL KICKOFF PATTERNS

### Anne-Laure Le Cunff / Ness Labs (Jan 13, 2026 - 82 min)

**Context:** Official kickoff with full team (Filip, Shannon, Jordan)

**Opening:**
JORDAN: "You are the only call that's happening for me this week. And yeah, I'm very excited to finally be here after talking with you a couple of months ago in Portugal."

ANNE-LAURE: "Yeah, I'm looking forward to it as well. And great to meet everyone as well."

**Team introduction (immediate):**
JORDAN: "So you got my video introduction of Filip and Shannon, and now here they are in the flesh."

**Validate intake form value:**
JORDAN: "That's a very common response, actually, on a lot of these onboarding calls is, wow, I've never had to sit down and really define and write out my answers to some of these kind of existential bigger questions about what am I trying to do?"

**Set expectations for partnership value:**
> "Clarity was something that you brought up in that document. And it's hard. It's hard to sit down by yourself and say, OK, I have 30 minutes. I'm going to now get a bunch of clarity about what I want. And that's really what one of our values is for you is being a sounding board and a mirror and also just asking you those hard things, but then sharpening it with you and helping you arrive at deeper clarity in a faster way than you would have been able to get to on your own."

**Present observations FIRST (not questions):**
> "Before we dive into questions, I just want to start by sharing some of the observations that we've already noticed from your intake and looking at your community. So you know that we're not just starting from scratch here and asking you all the basics."

**Anne-Laure's situation:**
- 84% activity rate (exceptional - "one of the hardest things")
- Value proposition not immediately clear (transformation gap)
- Ambitious people coming for different reasons
- Opportunity: once transformation clarified, everything gets easier

**Pattern:**
1. Celebrate milestone (excited to be working together)
2. Introduce full team immediately
3. Validate intake form work
4. Present observations (show you've done homework)
5. Identify core challenge/opportunity
6. Dive into strategic questions

### Eric Basmajian (Dec 23, 2025 - 62 min)

**Context:** Post-discovery kickoff, contract discussion phase

**Opening (rapport + decision context):**
ERIC: "To be entirely honest, I kind of was mostly aligned with what you presented. I have about four or five questions here for you, some on the contract, some on just general strategy."

**Contract clarity (Eric asked directly):**
ERIC: "So if everything goes horribly wrong, we don't make $1 together, my net risk would be 6,000 times 12 or 72,000. Is that fair to say?"

JORDAN: "Yes. It's never happened before, but yes. Worst case scenario."

**Eric's situation:**
- $35K/month total revenue ($20K from Circle, rest from Substack)
- Current offer: $2,000/year (too big a jump from free)
- Problem: Missing stepping stone between free and premium
- Goal: Fill gap with mid-tier offer
- Ideal target: Retire in 10 years (age 50-55)

**Pattern difference:**
- This is "pre-kickoff" (still discussing contract)
- 1-on-1 with Jordan (no team yet)
- More transactional (risk/reward discussion)
- Strategic questions about approach
- Building confidence before signing

**Key insight:**
Some clients need an extra "strategy session" between discovery and official kickoff to:
- Address contract questions
- Discuss risk/reward openly
- Clarify approach before commitment
- Build confidence in partnership
