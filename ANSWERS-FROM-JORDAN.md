# Answers from Jordan - Filling the Gaps

**Date:** 2026-02-07  
**Context:** Jordan answered key questions from System Map "Gaps & Questions" section

---

## 1. PRICING STRUCTURE

**Question:** How do you price? Retainer, project, hybrid?

**Answer:**
- **Model:** $6,000/month minimum retainer + 30% revenue share (whichever is greater)
- **How it works:** First few months default to $6K/month flat fee until we help them grow revenue to where 30% of net new revenue > $6K
- **Example:** If we help generate $25K/month in new revenue, 30% = $7,500, so they pay $7,500/month instead of $6K
- **Current offer:** Only selling "Growth Partnership" offer (this structure)

---

## 2. CONTRACTS & LEGAL

**Question:** When does paperwork happen?

**Answer:**
- **Timing:** Sales phase, AFTER they agree to work with us, BEFORE onboarding
- **Requirements before onboarding:**
  1. Contract signed
  2. First invoice paid
- **Gate:** Cannot start onboarding until both are complete

---

## 3. STRATEGY AUDIT TEMPLATE

**Question:** Do you have a template for strategy audits? What sections are always included?

**Answer:**
- **Current state:** Done a few times, but no super clear standards yet
- **Next step:** Jordan can provide examples later to simplify down
- **Status:** Template needs to be created from existing examples

---

## 4. LAUNCH PHASE DETAIL

**Question:** How do launches typically work? Do you do soft launches? What's the typical support cadence?

**Answer:**
- **Exists:** We have a "Community Launch Roadmap"
- **Next step:** Jordan will send the launch roadmap to show the steps
- **Status:** Document exists, needs to be extracted/integrated

## 5. HANDOFF TRIGGERS (Jordan → Filip/Shannon)

**Question:** When does Jordan → Filip/Shannon transition happen?

**Answer:**
- **Current:** Jordan very heavy in the beginning (sales, discovery, relationship, getting them to sign + onboard)
- **Goal:** Hand them to team earlier and earlier
- **Jordan's ideal role:** Only involved in things that ONLY HE can do that either:
  - Add surprise and delight
  - Deepen the relationship
  - Make them feel special
  - Provide unique value
- **Strategy:** Find ways to be less involved when it doesn't require Jordan specifically

## 6. DECISION TREES - When to Say NO

**Question:** When do you say no to a lead?

**Answer - Red Flags:**

### ❌ TOO SMALL AUDIENCE
- **Minimum:** 5,000-10,000 email subscribers OR social media followers
- **Note:** Still figuring out exact number, but "somewhere around there"

### ❌ NOT MONETIZING YET
- **Must have:** Already making money online by monetizing their expertise
- **Examples of acceptable monetization:**
  - Coaching
  - Consulting
  - Course
  - Book
  - "Something like that"

### ✅ IDEAL CLIENT CRITERIA
1. Has audience (5K-10K+ email/social)
2. Creates content
3. Makes money online already
4. Monetizes expertise

**Summary:** They need to be able to create content AND make money online BEFORE they're ready to work with us.

## 7. TEMPLATES & FRAMEWORKS WE USE

**Question:** What documents/frameworks do you use repeatedly?

**Answer - Three Key Templates:**

1. **4 Types of Community Framework**
   - Status: Mentioned, needs to be extracted/documented
   - Use case: Sales, design phase

2. **Community Launch Roadmap**
   - Status: Exists, Jordan will send
   - Use case: Launch phase

3. **Membership vs Cohort Model**
   - Status: Mentioned, needs to be extracted/documented
   - Use case: Design phase, offer structuring

## NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions:
1. ✅ Capture these answers (DONE - this file)
2. Update SYSTEM-MAP-v1.md gaps section
3. Create pricing/contracts section in sales playbook
4. Document qualification criteria clearly

### Pending from Jordan:
1. Strategy audit examples
2. Community Launch Roadmap document
3. 4 Types of Community Framework details
4. Membership vs Cohort Model framework

### To Extract/Create:
1. Pricing calculator/examples
2. Contract workflow/checklist
3. Qualification scorecard (audience size + monetization check)
4. Handoff criteria (when Jordan exits, team takes over)

---

**Impact:** This fills major gaps in the operations manual. Now we have:
- Clear pricing model
- Contract timing
- Qualification criteria (red flags)
- Handoff philosophy
- Key frameworks to document

**Status:** Ready to integrate into playbooks and system map.

## 8. CLIENT TRACKING REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL)

**Date Added:** 2026-02-07 2:46 PM

**The Key Metric:** Revenue growth & time to revenue share

### What to Track Monthly (Every Client):
1. Current monthly revenue
2. Net new revenue since starting with GC
3. Payment status: $6K flat OR 30% revenue share
4. Months to revenue share (how long it took)

### Why This Matters:

**Reason 1:** GC only wins when client reaches revenue share territory
- $6K flat = break-even, not profit maximization
- Revenue share = upside, client success = our success

**Reason 2:** $6K/month = client paying out of pocket (HURTS them)
- Real expense they feel every month
- Goal: Minimize time in this phase
- Need to track how long it takes to escape flat fee

**Reason 3:** Revenue share = FREE money for client
- 30% of NEW revenue (wouldn't have had without us)
- Doesn't cost them anything (incremental profit share)
- Pain-free payment (no budget impact)

### Break-even Point:
- Client needs $20K/month NEW revenue for 30% to exceed $6K
- $20K × 30% = $6K (break-even)
- $20K+ × 30% = Revenue share territory ✅

### Performance Indicator:
- **Fast to revenue share** = We're effective
- **Slow to revenue share** = Need to improve
- **Stuck at $6K** = Not delivering growth (red flag)

**Full details:** See `CLIENT-TRACKING-REQUIREMENTS.md`

**Status:** Requirements documented, ready to build into client tracking system.
