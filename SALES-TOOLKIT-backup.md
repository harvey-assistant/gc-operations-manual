## 🎯 THE DISCOVERY SEQUENCE (30-45 minutes)

### 1. RAPPORT (1-2 min)
**Purpose:** Connection, ease, warmth

**Script examples:**
- "How are you? Where are you calling from?"
- "I was just in [their city] last week - great weather/people/energy"
- [Let natural conversation flow, don't rush]

**Real example (Realize/Jake):**
> "What's up? How are you man? I'm doing great. Yeah, thanks dude. I love your energy."

---

### 2. DISCOVERY (15-20 min)
**Purpose:** Let THEM explain everything - current state, goals, challenges

**The Opening Question (Use One):**
- "What was the main motivation behind reaching out?" ⭐ (Most common)
- "What's going on? Fill me in, man."
- "Walk me through what you're up to."

**Then SHUT UP and let them talk for 10-15 minutes.**

**Follow-up questions (as needed):**
- "Who's the community for and what are you helping them do?"
- "How much are you charging them?"
- "How many members do you have?"
- "What would you say your biggest goals are?"
- "Is this scale fast and sell in 12 months, or get to $200K/month?" (strategic vision)
- "What would be some of the biggest challenges you'd want to immediately tackle?"
- [Dig into their current structure/model details]

**Key principle:** Ask open-ended questions, let them show you everything. Don't jump to solutions yet.

---

### 3. VALIDATION (2-3 min)
**Purpose:** Affirm what's working, build confidence, position yourself as peer

**Validation phrases Jordan uses:**
- "You're killing it already"
- "You're in the top 10-20% just by [specific thing they're doing]"
- "That's really impressive - most people don't [X]"
- "You've figured out the hardest part already"

**Real example (Austin Willman):**
> "You have a lot of ideas. That's great to have these."

**Why this matters:** People come to you often feeling inadequate or stuck. Validation opens them up and shows you see their strengths.

---

### 4. POSITIONING (10-15 min)
**Purpose:** Show offering, demonstrate expertise, use visual examples

**Method: SHOW DON'T TELL**
- Pull up a similar client example (share screen)
- "Let me show you what we did with [Client Name]"
- Walk through their Circle space, results, approach
- Point out 3-5 quick wins they could achieve

**Real example (Realize/Jake):**
> Jordan pulled up Exit Five community as visual example for Jake (accounting community)
> Showed structure, engagement, how it works
> "This is what [similar client] is doing - does this resonate?"

**Key examples to reference:**
- **Exit Five** (Dave Gerhardt) - 7-figure community, high engagement
- **Realize** (Jake Kessenich) - Accounting community, $75K/month, 500 members
- **Profit First** - Branded method example
- **StoryBrand** - Framework example

**Positioning phrases:**
- "Here's what we do..."
- "The way I think about it is..."
- "I've seen this work really well when..."

---

### 5. QUALIFICATION (2-3 min)
**Purpose:** Ensure fit - budget, timeline, readiness

**Qualification questions:**
- "Does it sound like alignment with what you're looking for - budget, timeline?"
- "Are you ready to move forward on something like this?"
- "What would need to be true for this to be a no-brainer?"

**Red flags to watch for:**
- Not the expert/authority in their space
- No audience/network to start with
- Not passionate about the topic
- Budget concerns (can't afford $4K+/month range)
- Timeline mismatch

**Real example (Austin Willman - RED FLAG):**
> Austin: "I don't run an agency... I'm not the expert, I'm not the authority"
> Jordan: "I haven't yet really seen a community thrive that isn't founder-led in some way, or expertise-led or driven."

---

### 6. SOFT CLOSE (1-2 min)
**Purpose:** Book next step without pressure

**Closing phrases:**
- "Let's chat more - want to book a follow-up?"
- "Does it make sense to continue this conversation?"
- "I think there's a lot we could do here - want to explore it further?"

**No hard close. No pressure. Just natural next step.**

---

## 🧠 KEY FRAMEWORKS & METHODOLOGIES

### "Opera Singer Breaking Glass" Principle ⭐⭐⭐

**Concept:** Use EXACT customer language to create visceral reaction

**How it works:**
1. Customer says: "I want to break the million dollar mark and elevate leadership systems"
2. YOU say it back VERBATIM in your positioning
3. They think: "Holy shit, you're reading my mind!"

**Why it works:**
- 99% of offers are lukewarm summaries
- Verbatim language hits the exact frequency that breaks the glass
- Emotional connection vs. technical correctness

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't summarize: "You want to grow your business" ❌
- Don't generalize: "You want to scale" ❌
- Don't paraphrase: "You want to stabilize operations" ❌

**What TO do:**
- Use their EXACT words: "Break the million dollar mark and elevate leadership systems" ✅
- Record calls and extract verbatim language ✅
- When unsure, ask: "What does [X] mean to you?" ✅

**Real example (Austin Cohen):**
> Jordan asked Empire clients to share goals verbatim
> Client said: "Break the million dollar mark and elevate leadership systems"
> Jordan: "The reason why I'm pushing so hard on this... we're trying to dial into the exact frequency that is going to cause a reaction."

---

### Problems-First Approach

**Traditional (wrong) order:**
1. I have ideas!
2. Let me build them
3. Hope someone wants them

**Jordan's order:**
1. Identify the PROBLEM first
2. Who has this problem?
3. How do we solve it?
4. THEN the idea/offer

**Real example (Austin Cohen):**
> Jordan: "We want to do things in the opposite way that's going to feel natural to you. You have a lot of ideas. We don't want to build ideas. We want to identify problems and then we want to identify how we solve those problems and who exactly we're solving it for. And then the idea is like the last piece."

---

### Enemy Positioning

**Concept:** Define what you're NOT (as important as what you ARE)

**Structure:**
- "This is for [specific people]"
- "This is NOT [generic alternative]"
- Creates differentiation and perceived value

**Real example (Austin Willman):**
> Jordan: "I think you got to get really specific, just like super clear on what this place is and almost have that enemy of what it's not. The enemy is, for you, potentially just another generic, vague, catch-all community for marketers or agency people."

**Other enemies to position against:**
- "Not another free Facebook group"
- "Not another course that sits on a shelf"
- "Not another generic community"
- "Not DIY - done WITH you"

---

### Simplicity is Ultimate Sophistication

**Concept:** Simple > Complex. Always.

**What to avoid:**
- "17 part, 21 day funnel, upsell, downsell, backsell automation"
- Multi-tier confusing pricing
- Overwhelming onboarding

**What to do:**
- One clear offer
- One clear promise
- One clear outcome
- "If you want X, we help you achieve Y in Z timeframe"

**Real example (Austin Cohen):**
> Jordan: "Steve Jobs or Einstein said, simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Instead of the 17 part, 21 day funnel, upsell, downsell, backsell automation... I want to do this: 'All you have to do is do this. One. There you go. Do you want to buy it?'"

---

## 🛑 OBJECTION HANDLING

### "I'm not the expert in this space"

**Response (transparency + reframe):**
> "I lean into transparency and vulnerability of like, hey guys, I'm not a seven-figure agency owner like all of you, so why in the world would I be here and be posting and be leading this thing? Because I think I have a special skill and a calling that none of you do, which is to facilitate and bring together your geniuses and to help pull out the things that are going to help one another."

**Key principle:** Don't hide it. Address it directly. Reframe role as facilitator/curator vs. expert.

---

### "I don't have an audience yet"

**Response (quality > quantity):**
> "You're in a bit of a tricky situation. The 80-20 rule is in effect at all times... you're really talking about having like two people potentially engaged right now. You really need that two people to be more like 20 or 200 as quickly as possible."

**Then discuss:**
- Who are the RIGHT people?
- Where can we find them?
- Quality > quantity always
- Wrong people worse than no people

---

### "How do I know this will work?"

**Response (social proof + examples):**
- Pull up specific client example: "Let me show you what we did with [Client]"
- Share metrics: "$75K/month, 500 members, 78% engagement"
- Reference recognizable names: "Dave Gerhardt's Exit Five", "Jake's Realize community"
- "We've built 100+ communities, $50M+ in creator revenue"

---

### "I don't know what to teach/offer"

**Response (problems-first):**
> "We want to identify problems and then we want to identify how we solve those problems and who exactly we're solving it for. And then the idea is like the last piece. So it's great to have these [ideas], but that's just like a quick reframe."

**Then:**
- Mine their existing clients' verbatim language
- Extract problems from conversations
- Build offer around solving those problems

---

## 🎬 REAL SALES CALL SCRIPTS

### Opening (Realize - Jake Kessenich)

**JORDAN:**
> "What's up? How are you man?"

**JAKE:**
> "I'm fantastic. Thank you so much for asking. How are you?"

**JORDAN:**
> "I'm doing great. Yeah, thanks, dude. I love your energy. Where are you calling from?"

**JAKE:**
> "I'm from Phoenix..."

[Natural rapport building for 1-2 minutes]

**JORDAN:**
> "So I'm excited to learn more about you and to connect with you and hear what you're up to. I'm curious, what was the main reason for you wanting to book a call?"

---

### Discovery Deep Dive (Eric Basmajian)

**JORDAN:**
> "Fill me in, man. What's going on?"

**ERIC:**
> "Yeah, so I've been running an economic research and consulting firm for the last eight years or so, taken a few different shapes and forms. Over the last year or two, we settled on trying to centralize our business around Circle as a distribution platform..."

[Let them talk for 10-15 minutes]

**JORDAN:**
> "How many subscribers do you have?"

**ERIC:**
> "Around 200 to 250 paying."

**JORDAN:**
> "And what are you charging?"

[Drill into specifics]

---

### Validation (Austin Willman)

**AUSTIN:**
> "I'm still pretty early in the journey of this community. It's still under $1,000 in recurring revenue, which is tough."

**JORDAN:**
> "So you have a lot of ideas. That's great to have these... Our job is to organize it and distill it down."

[Validates having ideas, then guides toward clarity]

---

### Objection Handling (Austin Willman)

**AUSTIN:**
> "Since I'm not the expert, I'm not the authority, I don't run an agency. I almost feel like I'm out of place when I post in the group."

**JORDAN:**
> "So what I do in that situation is I lean into a couple things. I lean into evidence and experience that I have in my life. So if you've had a great conversation with some eight-figure guy, then it's a great conversation regardless... And then the other thing I lean into is transparency and vulnerability of like, hey guys, I'm not a seven-figure agency owner like all of you, so why in the world would I be here and be posting and be leading this thing? Because I think I have a special skill and a calling that none of you do, which is to facilitate and bring together your geniuses..."
