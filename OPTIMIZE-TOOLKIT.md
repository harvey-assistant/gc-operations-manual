## 📅 WEEKLY SYNC STRUCTURE

### Pattern: Action Items → Metrics → Issues → Priorities

**Realize's Jan 28, 2026 Weekly Sync (34 minutes):**

**1. Action Items Review (5 min):**
> "I was thinking just of checking some of the action items from last week related to the project that we're all in, which is the community revamp." - Filip

**2. Current Issues (10 min):**
- Members not getting kicked out after cancellation
- Tally form credentials needed
- Exit survey bypass issue

**3. Solutions Discussion (15 min):**
- Filip reached out to Circle support
- Manual daily check for stuck members
- Updated cancellation flow

**4. Next Steps (4 min):**
- Assign owners
- Set deadlines
- Schedule follow-up

**Pattern:** Short (30-45 min), focused on action, documented in transcript.

## 🚪 CHURN MANAGEMENT

### Pattern: Exit Survey → Analysis → Win-Back (Sometimes)

**The cancellation flow challenge:**

**Two paths to cancel:**
1. **Managed cancellation:** Member clicks "Manage Account" → Tally form → Exit survey → Cancel
2. **Direct cancellation:** Member goes to billing → Cancel (bypasses survey)

**Jake's dilemma:**
> "If we're okay with some percentage of people not filling out the exit survey, and maybe we make the FAQs more prominent, like if you have to update your account, go to this link, then it probably solves it. Just knowing that you're not going to get 100% of the people to fill it out."

**Solution: Balance convenience vs data**
- Enable self-cancellation (don't make people ask permission)
- Prominently link to managed flow in FAQs
- Accept that not everyone will fill out survey
- Capture what you can, don't make friction too high

---

### Exit Survey Best Practices

**What to ask:**
1. **Why are you leaving?** (Multiple choice + other)
   - Too expensive
   - Not enough value
   - Not enough time
   - Found another solution
   - Other (explain)

2. **What would have made you stay?**
   - Free text response

3. **How likely are you to recommend?** (NPS)
   - 0-10 scale

4. **Can we follow up?**
   - Email for potential win-back

**What to track:**
- Churn reasons (aggregate over time)
- NPS trends
- Win-back success rate
- Lifetime value by cohort

---

## 🔧 AUTOMATION MAINTENANCE

### Pattern: Monitor → Report → Fix → Verify

**Common automation issues:**

**Issue 1: Members not removed after cancellation**
- **Symptom:** Canceled members still have access
- **Cause:** Payment migration edge cases
- **Fix:** Manual daily audit until Circle resolves
- **Prevention:** Test cancellation flow regularly

**Issue 2: Onboarding tags not applying**
- **Symptom:** Can't filter who scheduled calls
- **Cause:** Calendly → Circle integration broken
- **Fix:** Rebuild Make.com scenario
- **Prevention:** Weekly automation health check

**Issue 3: Squad assignments wrong**
- **Symptom:** Members in wrong squad
- **Cause:** Profile questions changed
- **Fix:** Update Make.com logic
- **Prevention:** Document profile → squad mapping

**Filip's approach:**
"I've checked the workflows... I cannot really identify any pattern, like why some members are being kicked out, why some not. So I've reached out to Circle, asking them what is going on. Until then, I can just daily hop in Circle, just kick them out manually."

**Key principle:** Manual workaround while investigating > letting members stay after canceling.

## 📊 KEY METRICS TO TRACK

### Weekly Metrics

**Growth:**
- New members this week
- Total active members
- Growth rate (%)

**Engagement:**
- Event attendance (total + unique)
- Posts created (members, not admin)
- Comments/reactions
- Active member % (engaged this week)

**Churn:**
- Cancellations this week
- Churn rate (%)
- Exit survey completion rate
- Top churn reasons

**Revenue:**
- MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
- New MRR
- Churned MRR
- Net MRR change

### Health Check Dashboard

**Green (Healthy):**
- Churn <5%/month
- Event attendance growing or stable
- Active member % >40%
- NPS >40

**Yellow (Watch):**
- Churn 5-8%/month
- Event attendance declining
- Active member % 25-40%
- NPS 20-40

**Red (Problem):**
- Churn >8%/month
- Event attendance in free fall
- Active member % <25%
- NPS <20

## 👥 TEAM SCALING TRIGGERS

### Pattern: Bottleneck → Document → Hire → Train

**When to hire (Realize's journey):**

**Hire 1: Pod Coordinator (Stephanie)**
- **Trigger:** Jake spending 10+ hours/week on pod placements
- **Solution:** Contract experienced facilitator as coordinator
- **Result:** Jake's time freed, smoother placements

**Hire 2: Dedicated Facilitators (Next hire)**
- **Trigger:** Busy firm owners can't commit to 90-min sessions
- **Solution:** Hire people whose job IS facilitation
- **Result:** Consistent quality, scalable model

**Jake's realization:**
> "The next hire is going to probably have to be somebody or some people to be pod facilitators that aren't firm owners and not busy. Somebody whose dedicated job is just to be a facilitator of 90-minute sessions for these groups."

**Hiring principle:** Don't hire until you've documented the role and proven it's a bottleneck.

## 🎯 ENGAGEMENT OPTIMIZATION

### Pattern: Measure → Experiment → Double Down

**What to optimize:**

**1. Event Attendance**
- **Track:** Attendance rate per event type
- **Experiment:** Different days/times, formats, topics
- **Double down:** Scale what works, kill what doesn't

**2. Post Engagement**
- **Track:** Comments per post, reaction rate
- **Experiment:** Question formats, prompts, challenges
- **Double down:** Templates for high-engagement posts

**3. First-Week Experience**
- **Track:** % completing onboarding, first event attended
- **Experiment:** Onboarding length, nudge timing
- **Double down:** Smooth path that converts to active

**4. Pod/Mastermind Retention**
- **Track:** Attendance rate, completion rate
- **Experiment:** Facilitator training, agenda formats
- **Double down:** Best facilitators, proven agendas

---

## 💬 MEMBER FEEDBACK LOOPS

### Pattern: Ask → Listen → Act → Tell

**How to collect feedback:**

**1. Exit Surveys**
- Required for managed cancellation
- Optional for direct cancellation
- Analyze quarterly

**2. Periodic Check-Ins**
- NPS survey (quarterly)
- "How are we doing?" DM (monthly to random sample)
- Post-event feedback (after major events)

**3. Community Listening**
- What questions come up repeatedly?
- What features do people request?
- What complaints surface?

**4. Team Observations**
- What breaks? What's smooth?
- What takes too much time?
- What delights members?

**Close the loop:**
> "We heard you wanted X. We built it. Here it is."

**Key principle:** Don't ask for feedback you won't act on.

---

## 🔄 CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT CYCLE

**Week 1:** Identify friction point
**Week 2:** Experiment with fix
**Week 3:** Measure result
**Week 4:** Scale or kill

**Realize example (Jan 2026):**
- **Friction:** Exit survey bypass
- **Experiment:** Prominent FAQ link to managed flow
- **Measure:** Survey completion rate
- **Result:** TBD (just implemented)

**Austin example (Dec 2025):**
- **Friction:** Pre-launch, building too much
- **Experiment:** Pre-sell first, build after
- **Measure:** 5-10 sign-ups before building
- **Result:** Validated demand, built with feedback

## 🚨 COMMON OPTIMIZE MISTAKES

**Mistake 1: Not tracking churn reasons**
- Flying blind on why people leave
- Can't fix what you don't measure
- Solution: Exit survey, analyze quarterly

**Mistake 2: Building before validating**
- Spend weeks on features nobody wants
- Opportunity cost of not building right thing
- Solution: Ask → Test → Build

**Mistake 3: Ignoring support volume**
- Same questions over and over
- Team overwhelmed
- Solution: FAQ, automation, documentation

**Mistake 4: Not firing bad facilitators**
- One bad experience kills retention
- "We can't find anyone better" paralysis
- Solution: Hire, train, evaluate, replace

**Mistake 5: Optimizing too many things at once**
- Can't tell what worked
- Team confused, scattered effort
- Solution: One big thing per week

## 💡 OPTIMIZE WISDOM

**From Jordan:**
- "We don't want to make it super prominent, like 'go here to cancel your subscription'"
- "Short-term manual workaround > letting members stay after canceling"

**From Jake:**
- "We get a handful [cancellations] a day, so it was way too much for me to do that"
- "The pods are what keep people around - that's our flagship program"
- "99% of people will schedule onboarding because it's helpful"
- "I hate when I'm jazzed up about something and have to pause momentum"

**From Filip:**
- "I cannot identify any pattern... so I've reached out to Circle support"
- "Let's do a daily manual check until we solve the root cause"
- "We can tag members with hidden tags depending on completion"
