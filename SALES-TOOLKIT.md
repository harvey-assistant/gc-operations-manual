## 🎯 THE DISCOVERY SEQUENCE (30-45 minutes)

### 1. RAPPORT (1-2 min)
**Purpose:** Connection, ease, warmth

**Script examples:**
- "How are you? Where are you calling from?"
- "I was just in [their city] last week - great weather/people/energy"
- [Let natural conversation flow, don't rush]

**Real example (Realize/Jake):**
> "What's up? How are you man? I'm doing great. Yeah, thanks dude. I love your energy."

---

### 2. DISCOVERY (15-20 min)
**Purpose:** Let THEM explain everything - current state, goals, challenges

**The Opening Question (Use One):**
- "What was the main motivation behind reaching out?" ⭐ (Most common)
- "What's going on? Fill me in, man."
- "Walk me through what you're up to."

**Then SHUT UP and let them talk for 10-15 minutes.**

**Follow-up questions (as needed):**
- "Who's the community for and what are you helping them do?"
- "How much are you charging them?"
- "How many members do you have?"
- "What would you say your biggest goals are?"
- "Is this scale fast and sell in 12 months, or get to $200K/month?" (strategic vision)
- "What would be some of the biggest challenges you'd want to immediately tackle?"
- [Dig into their current structure/model details]

**Key principle:** Ask open-ended questions, let them show you everything. Don't jump to solutions yet.

---

### 3. VALIDATION (2-3 min)
**Purpose:** Affirm what's working, build confidence, position yourself as peer

**Validation phrases Jordan uses:**
- "You're killing it already"
- "You're in the top 10-20% just by [specific thing they're doing]"
- "That's really impressive - most people don't [X]"
- "You've figured out the hardest part already"

**Real example (Luca Rossi):**
> Jordan: "Great. I appreciate that background. That's really helpful."
> [After Luca explains his 160K subscribers and pivot strategy]

**Real example (Anne-Laure):**
> Jordan: "Yeah, that's really helpful to understand."
> [Validates her positioning and brand strength despite low community investment]

**Why this matters:** People come to you often feeling inadequate or stuck. Validation opens them up and shows you see their strengths.

---

### 4. POSITIONING (10-15 min)
**Purpose:** Show offering, demonstrate expertise, use visual examples

**Method: SHOW DON'T TELL**
- Pull up a similar client example (share screen)
- "Let me show you what we did with [Client Name]"
- Walk through their Circle space, results, approach
- Point out 3-5 quick wins they could achieve

**Real example (Realize/Jake):**
> Jordan pulled up Exit Five community as visual example for Jake (accounting community)
> Showed structure, engagement, how it works
> "This is what [similar client] is doing - does this resonate?"

**Key examples to reference:**
- **Exit Five** (Dave Gerhardt) - 7-figure community, high engagement
- **Realize** (Jake Kessenich) - Accounting community, $75K/month, 500 members
- **Profit First** - Branded method example
- **StoryBrand** - Framework example

**Positioning phrases:**
- "Here's what we do..."
- "The way I think about it is..."
- "I've seen this work really well when..."

---

### 5. QUALIFICATION (2-3 min)
**Purpose:** Ensure fit - budget, timeline, readiness

**Qualification questions:**
- "Does it sound like alignment with what you're looking for - budget, timeline?"
- "Are you ready to move forward on something like this?"
- "What would need to be true for this to be a no-brainer?"

**Red flags to watch for:**
- Not the expert/authority in their space
- No audience/network to start with
- Not passionate about the topic
- Budget concerns (can't afford $4K+/month range)
- Timeline mismatch

**Red flag example (from experience):**
> When founder isn't the expert/authority in their space
> Jordan's filter: "I haven't yet really seen a community thrive that isn't founder-led in some way, or expertise-led or driven."

---

### 6. SOFT CLOSE (1-2 min)
**Purpose:** Book next step without pressure

**Closing phrases:**
- "Let's chat more - want to book a follow-up?"
- "Does it make sense to continue this conversation?"
- "I think there's a lot we could do here - want to explore it further?"

**No hard close. No pressure. Just natural next step.**

---

## 💰 PRICING & OFFER STRUCTURE

### Growth Partnership Offer

**Model:** $6,000/month minimum retainer + 30% revenue share (whichever is greater)

**How it works:**
- Client pays $6K/month OR 30% of net new revenue, whichever is higher each month
- First few months: Typically default to $6K flat fee
- As we help grow revenue: Eventually 30% of new revenue exceeds $6K
- At that point: Client shifts to revenue share payment

**Break-even calculation:**
- Client needs $20K+/month in NEW revenue for 30% to exceed $6K
- $20K × 30% = $6K (break-even point)
- $25K × 30% = $7,500/month (now paying revenue share)

**Why this structure:**
- Aligns incentives: We only win big when they win big
- Lower risk for client: If we don't deliver growth, they pay minimum
- Upside for GC: Revenue share scales with client success
- Performance metric: Time to revenue share = our effectiveness

**Client psychology:**
- **$6K/month phase:** Paying from existing budget/pocket (hurts)
- **Revenue share phase:** Paying from NEW revenue we generated (doesn't hurt)
- Goal: Get them to revenue share as fast as possible

**What to say in discovery:**
> "Our model is $6,000 a month or 30% of the new revenue we help you generate, whichever is greater. So in the beginning, you'll be paying the $6K minimum while we're building and growing things. But our goal is to grow your revenue to the point where that 30% of new revenue becomes more than $6K - because that means we're actually moving the needle for you. And at that point, you're only paying us out of revenue you wouldn't have had without us, so it becomes completely self-funding."

---

## 📋 CONTRACTS & LEGAL

**Timing:** Sales phase, AFTER they verbally agree, BEFORE onboarding starts

**Requirements before onboarding:**
1. ✅ Contract signed
2. ✅ First invoice paid ($6,000)

**Gate:** Cannot begin onboarding/kickoff until both are complete

**Process:**
1. Discovery call → verbal agreement to move forward
2. Send contract + first invoice
3. Wait for signature + payment
4. THEN schedule kickoff/onboarding call

**Why this order matters:**
- No work begins until they're financially committed
- First payment demonstrates seriousness
- Protects team time/resources

---

## 🧠 KEY FRAMEWORKS & METHODOLOGIES

### "Opera Singer Breaking Glass" Principle ⭐⭐⭐

**Concept:** Use EXACT customer language to create visceral reaction

**How it works:**
1. Customer says: "I want to break the million dollar mark and elevate leadership systems"
2. YOU say it back VERBATIM in your positioning
3. They think: "Holy shit, you're reading my mind!"

**Why it works:**
- 99% of offers are lukewarm summaries
- Verbatim language hits the exact frequency that breaks the glass
- Emotional connection vs. technical correctness

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't summarize: "You want to grow your business" ❌
- Don't generalize: "You want to scale" ❌
- Don't paraphrase: "You want to stabilize operations" ❌

**What TO do:**
- Use their EXACT words: "Break the million dollar mark and elevate leadership systems" ✅
- Record calls and extract verbatim language ✅
- When unsure, ask: "What does [X] mean to you?" ✅

**Real example (Austin Cohen):**
> Jordan asked Empire clients to share goals verbatim
> Client said: "Break the million dollar mark and elevate leadership systems"
> Jordan: "The reason why I'm pushing so hard on this... we're trying to dial into the exact frequency that is going to cause a reaction."

---

### Problems-First Approach

**Traditional (wrong) order:**
1. I have ideas!
2. Let me build them
3. Hope someone wants them

**Jordan's order:**
1. Identify the PROBLEM first
2. Who has this problem?
3. How do we solve it?
4. THEN the idea/offer

**Real example (Austin Cohen):**
> Jordan: "We want to do things in the opposite way that's going to feel natural to you. You have a lot of ideas. We don't want to build ideas. We want to identify problems and then we want to identify how we solve those problems and who exactly we're solving it for. And then the idea is like the last piece."

---

### Enemy Positioning

**Concept:** Define what you're NOT (as important as what you ARE)

**Structure:**
- "This is for [specific people]"
- "This is NOT [generic alternative]"
- Creates differentiation and perceived value

**Real example (Nicolas/AI Finance Club):**
> Jordan positioning retention as upstream problem: "A lot of the retention things are actually happening very, very high upstream, very early from the moment that they onboard... it's like we want to make sure that they stay in love with us instead of just stop them from breaking up with us at the end, right?"

**Other enemies to position against:**
- "Not another free Facebook group"
- "Not another course that sits on a shelf"
- "Not another generic community"
- "Not DIY - done WITH you"

---

### Simplicity is Ultimate Sophistication

**Concept:** Simple > Complex. Always.

**What to avoid:**
- "17 part, 21 day funnel, upsell, downsell, backsell automation"
- Multi-tier confusing pricing
- Overwhelming onboarding

**What to do:**
- One clear offer
- One clear promise
- One clear outcome
- "If you want X, we help you achieve Y in Z timeframe"

**Real example (Austin Cohen):**
> Jordan: "Steve Jobs or Einstein said, simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Instead of the 17 part, 21 day funnel, upsell, downsell, backsell automation... I want to do this: 'All you have to do is do this. One. There you go. Do you want to buy it?'"

---

## 🛑 OBJECTION HANDLING

### "I'm not the expert in this space"

**Response (transparency + reframe):**
> "I lean into transparency and vulnerability of like, hey guys, I'm not a seven-figure agency owner like all of you, so why in the world would I be here and be posting and be leading this thing? Because I think I have a special skill and a calling that none of you do, which is to facilitate and bring together your geniuses and to help pull out the things that are going to help one another."

**Key principle:** Don't hide it. Address it directly. Reframe role as facilitator/curator vs. expert.

---

### "I don't have an audience yet"

**Response (quality > quantity):**
> "You're in a bit of a tricky situation. The 80-20 rule is in effect at all times... you're really talking about having like two people potentially engaged right now. You really need that two people to be more like 20 or 200 as quickly as possible."

**Then discuss:**
- Who are the RIGHT people?
- Where can we find them?
- Quality > quantity always
- Wrong people worse than no people

---

### "How do I know this will work?"

**Response (social proof + examples):**
- Pull up specific client example: "Let me show you what we did with [Client]"
- Share metrics: "$75K/month, 500 members, 78% engagement"
- Reference recognizable names: "Dave Gerhardt's Exit Five", "Jake's Realize community"
- "We've built 100+ communities, $50M+ in creator revenue"

---

### "I don't know what to teach/offer"

**Response (problems-first):**
> "We want to identify problems and then we want to identify how we solve those problems and who exactly we're solving it for. And then the idea is like the last piece. So it's great to have these [ideas], but that's just like a quick reframe."

**Then:**
- Mine their existing clients' verbatim language
- Extract problems from conversations
- Build offer around solving those problems

- "Really good at content, really good at bringing people in. I don't think we are good at the fulfillment part."
- Engagement not where they want it
- Busy audience (CFOs, CEOs) - hard to translate value
- Scattered before (Memberpress + Teachable + Slack + Zoom → Circle helped)

**Key quote from Nicolas:**
> "We are really good at the content, really good at bringing people in. I don't think we are good at the fulfillment part... between when they're excited depending on when they buy and then three months after or 12 months after, how do we get the same energy over these 12 months that they stay?"

- Wants passive income model (not cohort burnout)
- Needs growth strategy without adding work

**Discovery insights:**
- Mighty Networks vs. Circle decision (Circle offered match + introduced Jordan)
- High engagement despite low investment (community manager does great work)
- Wants to avoid cohort model (burnout risk)
- Loves writing/research, wants Ness Labs to run smoothly with minimal time

### Eric Basmajian (About to Sign - Discovery Deep Dive)

**Context:**
- Economic research and consulting firm (8 years)
- $35K/month total revenue, $20K through Circle
- One offer: $2,000/year or $195/month subscription
- 120K Twitter, 110K YouTube, 10K Substack (free)
- On Circle ~2 years, doing "rudimentary" ad hoc approach
- Economic analyst, not marketer: "I know really nothing about marketing and community building"

**Three customer buckets (equal revenue split):**
1. High net worth individuals ($10M-$30M+ who self-invest)
2. Asset management (hedge funds, private equity)
3. Corporate management (construction, manufacturing - economically sensitive businesses)

**Transformation:**
> "Forecast economic inflection points to help them make better business or investment decisions around hiring, corporate planning, and for the investment community for investments."

**Pain points:**
- Big gap: Free content → $2,000/year (no stepping stone offer)
- Conversion issue between free and paid
- No courses (realizes this is a gap)
- "Just an analyst" - not community builder
- Ad hoc approach, no formula/strategy
- Not leveraging Circle effectively

**Key quotes from Eric:**
> "I don't really have an approach that I'm following. It's pretty ad hoc."
> "I assume that a big missing link is that first stepping stone... maybe courses or something that you could offer for a couple hundred bucks as a one-time payment, and then funnel people into the subscription product."

**Discovery insights:**
- Found Jordan through Circle referral program
- Already has strong product-market fit ($20K/month Circle revenue)
- Needs optimization + offer ladder (not rebuild)
- Type 1: Optimize & Grow
- Clear self-awareness of gaps

**When to reference:**
- Expert in their field, not in community building
- High-ticket offer with no stepping stones
- Free content → paid conversion gap
- Strong audience, weak funnel
- Research/analyst mindset (like Anne-Laure but different vertical)
- Already on Circle but not optimized

**ANNE-LAURE:**
