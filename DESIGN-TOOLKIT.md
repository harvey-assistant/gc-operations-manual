## 🎯 THE DESIGN SEQUENCE (3-4 weeks, meeting every 2-3 days initially)

### Phase 1: OUTCOMES CLARIFICATION (Week 1 - "10% Clear")

**Purpose:** Get crystal clear on what transformation you're selling

**Process:**
1. Review their stated goals from intake
2. Ask clarifying questions about each outcome
3. Listen for gaps or missing outcomes
4. Prioritize outcomes (what matters most?)
5. Identify outcome conflicts (trade-offs)

**Key questions:**
- "What outcomes matter most to your people?"
- "Which outcome would sell the most seats?"
- "What transformation do they want most?"
- "What are they trying to avoid?"
- "What's the gap between where they are and where they want to be?"

**Real example - Austin Cohen (Nov 7, 2025):**

JORDAN: "Last time we talked a lot about the outcomes... Selling your practice, a business that runs whether you're there or not, increasing profit margin, retaining patients longer, opening up a second location. I noticed we didn't call out revenue."

AUSTIN: "For those people, they're thinking about it from the retention side. It's a huge churn problem."

JORDAN: "So it's about keeping people longer to get to a million?"

AUSTIN: "Exactly."

**Pattern:** Jordan revisits previous session, clarifies what he heard, asks about what's missing, listens for the real problem (churn, not revenue).

---

### Phase 2: TARGET AUDIENCE DEFINITION (Week 2 - "50% Clear")

**Purpose:** Define WHO specifically you're serving

**Process:**
1. Identify current state of ideal customer
2. Define desired state clearly
3. Quantify the gap (numbers, metrics)
4. Understand their language (exact words)
5. Position against alternatives

**Key questions:**
- "Who exactly is this for?"
- "What's their current reality?"
- "What revenue/size are they at now?"
- "Where do they want to be?"
- "What have they already tried?"
- "What are they frustrated with?"

**Real example - Austin Cohen (Nov 7, 2025):**

AUSTIN: "Most chiropractors get to about $250-300K a year. That's the average. Most will never get to the 50K a month mark."

JORDAN: "So there's huge opportunity to target the ones doing $25-35K/month and say 'Hey, if you've always dreamed about getting to 50K a month, I'm going show you exactly how to do it WITHOUT selling your soul to services you don't want to use.'"

AUSTIN: "That's exactly right."

**Pattern:** Define the specific segment (25-35K → 50K), position against what they DON'T want (services dilution), use their exact language.

---

### Phase 3: OFFER STRUCTURE + POSITIONING (Week 3 - "99% Clear")

**Purpose:** Define what you're selling and how you're positioning it

**Process:**
1. Clarify the format (cohort, membership, hybrid)
2. Define deliverables (what they get)
3. Position against alternatives (enemy)
4. Price based on transformation value
5. Test messaging with customer language

**Key questions:**
- "What format serves this transformation best?"
- "What's included? What's NOT included?"
- "What are they currently using that doesn't work?"
- "What would they pay for this outcome?"
- "How would you explain this in one sentence?"

**Real example - Austin Cohen (Nov 7, 2025):**

[Extracting full offer design conversation...]

**Pattern:** Start with transformation, work backward to format, position against what they're escaping, validate pricing with value.

---

## 🔑 KEY FRAMEWORKS & METHODOLOGIES

### Iterative Clarity Model: 10% → 50% → 99% ⭐⭐⭐

**Core principle:** Don't try to figure everything out on day 1

**10% Clear (Week 1):**
- Rough outcomes identified
- General direction set
- First priorities clear
- Something to react to

**50% Clear (Week 2-3):**
- Target avatar defined
- Offer format determined
- Rough pricing range
- Key differentiators emerging

**99% Clear (Week 3-4):**
- Everything locked in
- Customer validation complete
- Confident to execute
- Ready to build

**Why it works:**
- Reduces overwhelm
- Creates momentum fast
- Allows course correction
- Builds confidence through iteration

**Quote from Austin Cohen kickoff:**
> "So this is something that is going to grow and evolve and change over time... our goal is to be a thought partner with you, a growth partner, help you see things that are hard for you to see because you're the expert, you're inside the jar, and it's hard to read your own label when you're on the inside."

---

### Problems-First Approach (Not Ideas-First) ⭐⭐⭐

**Wrong way:** "I have this idea for a community..."

**Right way:** "My people have this problem... who has it worst?... how do we solve it?... now what's the idea?"

**Sequence:**
1. Identify the problem (churn, scaling, profit)
2. Define who has it worst (25-35K chiropractors)
3. Understand what they've tried (services dilution)
4. Design solution (retention mastery)
5. Package as offer (Empire program)

**Why it works:**
- Ensures market demand exists
- Makes positioning obvious
- Pricing becomes easier
- Messaging writes itself

---

### "Opera Singer Breaking Glass" Principle ⭐⭐⭐

**Concept:** Use EXACT customer language, not your summary

**Wrong:** "Help you grow your business"

**Right:** "Break the million dollar mark" (if that's what they said)

**Application in design:**
- Capture verbatim language from discovery
- Use their exact words in offer description
- Don't translate or improve their language
- Visceral reaction comes from precision

**Real example - Austin Cohen:**
Customer language: "Break the million dollar mark" (exact words)
Not: "Achieve revenue growth" (summary/translation)

---

### Enemy Positioning ⭐⭐⭐

**Concept:** Define what you're NOT as important as what you ARE

**Formula:** "[Outcome] WITHOUT [Thing They Hate]"

**Real example - Austin Cohen:**
> "Get to 50K/month WITHOUT selling your soul to services you don't want to use"

**Why it works:**
- Differentiates immediately
- Positions against real alternatives
- Shows you understand their frustration
- Creates "us vs them" clarity

**Application:**
- Ask: "What have you tried that didn't work?"
- Ask: "What do you NOT want to become?"
- Position: "[Outcome] WITHOUT [That Thing]"

---

## 🎬 REAL DESIGN SESSION PATTERNS

### Austin Cohen (Nov 7, 2025 - 62 min follow-up)

**Context:** Second design meeting after kickoff, refining outcomes + target

**Opening (reconnect to previous session):**

JORDAN: "Let me kind of catch us back up to where we were? Because I feel like last time we got about halfway through where I wanted to get. So today was really just about continuing on that path."

**Outcomes clarification:**

JORDAN: "Last time we talked a lot about the outcomes... Selling your practice, business that runs whether you're there or not, increasing profit margin, retaining patients longer, opening up second location. I noticed that we didn't call out revenue."

AUSTIN: "For those people, they're thinking about it from the retention side. It's a huge churn problem."

**Target definition (with numbers):**

AUSTIN: "Most chiropractors get to about 250-300K a year. That's the average. Most will never get to the 50K a month mark. So there's huge opportunity to target the ones doing 25-35K/month."

**Positioning emerges:**

JORDAN: "They believe the way you grow is by doing more and doing more of more - more services, more options, more therapies, more treatments - instead of just going deeper in your expertise and doing it better, right?"

AUSTIN: "That's exactly right."

**Pattern:**
1. Reconnect to where you left off
2. Clarify what you heard last time
3. Ask about what's missing
4. Define target with specific numbers
5. Position against what doesn't work

**Last updated:** 2026-02-07 15:25

---

### Luca Rossi (Feb 4, 2026 - 66 min membership pivot session)

**Context:** Full team (Filip leading, Jordan/Shannon supporting), redesigning existing membership

**Filip's Design Session Structure:**

**1. CLARIFY TOP PRIORITY/OUTCOME (5 min):**

FILIP: "What's the one thing you most want to get clarity on today about this membership?"

LUCA: "Clarity on what the best possible refactoring membership looks like... what is the best scope that we can find for a membership that has great product market fit and that we can confidently deliver in a short time and grow?"

**Pattern:** Start with the outcome for the session itself - what do they need to walk away with?

---

**2. WHO IS THIS FOR? (10-15 min):**

FILIP: "Who is this membership for? We want to get this right because everything else gets easier later on."

**Their hypothesis (from survey data):**
"This membership is for senior and staff level engineers, as well as engineering managers who are moving from being great individual contributors into leadership roles."

LUCA: "Perfect. It's like something I could have said myself."

**Then dig deeper:**
- WHO NOT? "Junior engineers probably are not getting a lot of value out of this"
- Company size? "Perfect fit is small to mid-size companies, but it's a spectrum"
- Qualification? "I would say no... roles in tech are very fluid"

**Pattern:** Present hypothesis first (based on data), get confirmation, then clarify boundaries.

---

**3. WHAT DO THEY STRUGGLE WITH? (Problems list):**

FILIP: "Problems they have that are keeping them up at night..."
- "Am I making the right calls?"
- "How do I lead effectively without losing my technical edge?"
- "How do I handle team dynamics and organizational politics?"

FILIP: "How does this resonate? Am I missing something?"

LUCA: "It's probably not all the possible problems, it's one set of problems, but it's a good fit for what I've written."

**Pattern:** Present problems list, ask for validation, allow for additions.

---

**4. FOREVER PROMISE (What they can always count on):**

FILIP: "This is NOT a feature list. This is what we want to come up as the reason they want to stay month after month."

**Their version:**
"This membership helps senior engineers and managers make better decisions, run smoother teams, and feel in control of their role."

**Pattern:** Promise is about transformation, not features.

---

**5. DELIVERABLES (What's included):**

FILIP: "Two live sessions per month as base cadence... curated peer group... your unfiltered perspective..."

LUCA: "I would expect maybe a higher, stronger focus on all the historical content that we have that we can use as landing tracks or self-serve educational material."

**Then ask:**
- "Why should they stay another month?"
- "What would be a unique thing you offer?"
- "What is out of scope?"

LUCA (unique): "The breadth and depth of topics... five years of material... and we run a community in Circle with professional CTOs and coaches. Most communities are very low touch."

LUCA (out of scope): "I don't want to promise very technical content about specific frameworks or languages."

**Pattern:** Present deliverables, get feedback, clarify uniqueness and boundaries.

---

**6. PRICING (The validation conversation):**

SHANNON: "What would make this feel like 10x the value they're getting?"

JORDAN: "There's no way to validate the price without validating the price. The only way to validate is you ask someone to pay it and find out if they say yes or no."

**Pricing strategy discussed:**
- Current: $15/month (5% churn)
- Target: $150/month (but risk 20% churn)
- Solution: **Stair-step approach** - Start at $47-$97, test, increase

JORDAN: "I like this limited idea of, we'll let the first 10, 20, 50 people pay $47/month on this new thing. That can also create some urgency and scarcity."

**Key principle - Outcome-based pricing:**

JORDAN: "What if it was learning how to actually practically, tangibly start compounding your real-world growth and time savings? If you're paying $150/month and I'm starting to stack two hours of time saved this month, then two hours next month, that compounds to four, then six..."

LUCA: "I think our best bet is along the lines of 'make your team ship faster.' If your team gets 5% faster when you're factoring payroll for engineers, it's 100x value over the membership."

**Pattern:**
1. Don't obsess over exact price - pick something to test
2. Start lower than ideal (founding member pricing)
3. Limit slots (first 10-50)
4. Attach price to outcome value (time saved, speed increased)
5. Iterate up based on demand

---

### Anne-Laure Le Cunff (Jan 20, 2026 - 64 min strategy session)

**Context:** Strategy brief workshop, full team, filling in scaffolding document

**JORDAN'S STRATEGY BRIEF APPROACH:**

**1. START WITH THE END IN MIND:**

JORDAN: "How would you describe the goal of what we are trying to create together? Both internally (for you personally) and externally (for your members)."

ANNE-LAURE: "Clarity. Even clarity in terms of product/service we're offering. Knowing exactly what the transformation we're offering is, which I don't think is the case right now."

**Pattern:** Ask for internal AND external goals - what do they want, what do members get?

---

**2. DEFINE BOUNDARIES/GUARDRAILS:**

JORDAN: "Help us understand your guardrails or boundaries."

**Personal goals:**
- Revenue: 50K MRR
- Time: 2 hours/week (end state when running smoothly)
- Team: Small (James Clear model, not Ali Abdaal)
- Timeline: Sustainable > fast

ANNE-LAURE: "If tomorrow we have 100K a month, but it's based on me having to spend 30 hours a week on it... that's not what I want."

**Pattern:** Get clear on constraints BEFORE designing the offer.

---

**3. STRATEGY BRIEF DOCUMENT:**

JORDAN: "This is really to be a high-level plan, what we call a 10% up to 50% strategy plan, not extreme detail. We've started getting some of our notes on this one document. So we'll use this over the next couple weeks."

**What goes in strategy brief:**
- Goals (internal + external)
- Boundaries/guardrails
- Target audience
- Current state analysis
- Opportunity areas
- Next research steps

**Pattern:** Consolidate everything on one document, fill in scaffolding together live.

---

## 💰 PRICING METHODOLOGY

### Core Principles:

**1. "No way to validate price without validating price"**
- Don't overthink it
- Pick something reasonable to test
- Learn from market response

**2. Stair-Step Approach (Alex Hormozi model)**
- Start lower than "ideal"
- Test with first 5-10-50 people
- Get feedback, improve offer
- Raise price 10% with each cohort
- Stop when demand drops

**3. Outcome-Based Pricing**
- Attach price to tangible outcomes
- "2 hours saved/week compounds to massive value"
- "5% team velocity increase = 100x membership cost"
- Make ROI calculation obvious

**4. Founding Member Strategy**
- Limited slots at lower price
- Creates urgency/scarcity
- Explicitly: "First 50 at $47, then $75, then $97"
- Builds momentum fast

**5. Personal Budget vs Expense**
- Keep under $100/month for personal credit card
- Over $100 usually requires expense approval
- Balance: High enough to be taken seriously, low enough to be impulse-buy

### Pricing Test Framework:

**Step 1: Define value outcome**
- What measurable result do they get?
- How much is that worth to them?
- What's the ROI multiple?

**Step 2: Set founding price**
- Start 50-70% of "ideal" price
- Make it a no-brainer for first cohort
- Limited to 10-50 people

**Step 3: Communicate the climb**
- "First 10: $47/mo, then $75, then $97"
- "Lock in founding rate forever"
- Creates urgency without pressure

**Step 4: Monitor and iterate**
- If 10 people sign up in 24 hours → price too low
- If 0 people sign up in 2 weeks → messaging or price issue
- Adjust based on actual behavior

## 🎨 JAKE WYSOCKI'S DESIGN METHODOLOGY

**Who:** Jake Wysocki (Intention Craft) - Design thinking expert who works with Jordan's team and clients  
**Approach:** Design thinking + empathy mapping + customer language refinement  
**Clients worked with:** Austin Cohen, Luca Rossi (so far)

---

### Jake's Core Frameworks

#### 1. **"Brain on Speakerphone"** ⭐⭐⭐

**Concept:** Get raw, unfiltered thoughts out before refining

**How Jake uses it:**
> "Put your brain on speakerphone. Just tell me whatever comes to mind."

**Why it works:**
- Prevents self-editing/filtering
- Captures authentic language
- Reveals blind spots
- Gets past "expert curse of knowledge"

---

#### 2. **Best/Worst Outcome Questions**

**Opening questions Jake asks:**

**Best outcome:**
> "When you imagine this community or program going really well, what does that look like?"

**Worst outcome:**
> "What's the version of this community you're determined NOT to create? What are you trying to avoid?"

**Austin Cohen's answers:**
- **Best:** "Everybody's asking for more. They want more content, more programs, more coaching... seeing huge impact on legacy of chiropractic."
- **Worst:** "They get a lot of tools but nothing gets implemented... another thing that gets put on their shelf."

**Why this matters:**
- Defines success criteria upfront
- Clarifies boundaries (what you WON'T do)
- Creates guardrails for design decisions

---

#### 3. **"Sell Them What They Want, Give Them What They Need"** ⭐⭐⭐

**Core positioning principle:**

JAKE: "The goal here is going to be to sell them what they want, but give them what they need."

**Example - Austin Cohen:**
- **What they WANT:** Consistent new patients (marketing engine)
- **What they NEED:** Backend systems to handle those patients (staff training, patient experience, core values, vision)
- **The offer:** "We'll bring the people to you AND help you build the systems to handle them without burning down."

**Why it works:**
- Leads with pain they recognize
- Delivers transformation they didn't know they needed
- Creates upsell path (they succeed, want more)

---

#### 4. **Promise Statement** ⭐⭐⭐

**Jake's definition:**
> "Simple, punchy, short statement that gets someone to say 'hell yeah, I want that, where do I sign up?' It's the dream outcome they want, not the how you're doing it."

**Iterative refinement process:**

JAKE: "How would you describe your ideal client in a short way?"

AUSTIN: "Single location chiropractors who are tired of the consistent lack of consistency... stuck at 25-45K, lifestyle adapted to expenses, ready to put the work in."

JAKE: "And what's the dream outcome?"

[Keep refining until it's ONE punchy line]

**What makes a good promise:**
- One sentence (or less)
- Dream outcome focused
- Makes them say "hell yeah!"
- NOT feature-based
- NOT how you do it

---

#### 5. **Empathy Mapping (Design Thinking)** ⭐⭐⭐

**Framework:** SAY → THINK → FEEL → DO

**Before state:**
- **SAY:** "We got no time to try new things"
- **THINK:** "Big initiatives require hard negotiations with stakeholders"
- **FEEL:** Nervous, overwhelmed
- **DO:** Avoid change, stay in firefighting mode

**After state (desired):**
- **SAY:** "This is lighter than I thought, fits into day-to-day"
- **THINK:** "Small steady changes compound over time"
- **FEEL:** Confident, in control
- **DO:** Implement incrementally without permission

**How Jake facilitates this:**

JAKE: "After they go through your program, what are they going to be able to say, think, feel, and do?"

LUCA: "I have a question - how do you define the difference between say vs think or think vs feel?"

JAKE: "Sometimes there isn't a difference and there doesn't have to be. This comes from design thinking for empathy mapping. If there's a difference, say it. If not, it's OK. It's more to cover the grounds of what you hear them say vs. what you understand them to be thinking."

---

#### 6. **Pre-Work + Whiteboard Sessions**

**Jake's process:**
1. **Before session:** Sends workbook/video prep work
2. **During session:** Collaborative whiteboard (Miro/FigJam)
3. **Live documentation:** Jake types while they talk
4. **Visual iteration:** Move sticky notes, refine in real-time

**Tools mentioned:**
- Workbook (pre-work questionnaire)
- Whiteboard software (visual collaboration)
- Cursors visible (everyone can see each other working)
- Recording + transcription (Fathom)

---

#### 7. **Clarifying Questions (Constant Push)**

**Jake's questioning style:**

"Let me push on that a little further..."  
"Tell me more about that."  
"Is that too big? Does that make sense?"  
"Do you have a strong preference?"  
"Are you trying to actually help them solve [X], or is that too big?"

**Pattern:** Never accepts first answer - always pushes one layer deeper.

**Example exchange:**

AUSTIN: "They need consistent new patients."

JAKE: "So is that what you want to help people solve? Is that the main dream outcome?"

AUSTIN: "Here's the problem - if they had that, they wouldn't be able to handle it because they don't have the systems."

JAKE: "So are you trying to help them solve the problem of consistent new patients AND the things that support it? Or is that too big?"

**Why it works:** Reveals the REAL problem behind the surface problem.

- **Filip:** Structures execution, documents process
- **Shannon:** Tests pricing, adds tactical layers

---

### Real Examples of Jake's Impact

#### Austin Cohen - Promise Evolution

**Starting point:** "Help chiropractors grow"

**Jake's questions:** "Who specifically? What do they want? What's preventing them?"

**After 60 minutes:** "Help single-location chiropractors (stuck at $25-45K) build a marketing engine that brings 20-50 new patients monthly AND the backend systems to handle them without burning down."

**Key shifts:**
- Specific avatar (25-45K → 50-80K)
- Tangible outcome (20-50 patients/month)
- Addresses hidden objection (systems to handle growth)
- Positions against alternative (not just marketing)

---

#### Luca Rossi - "No Time" Reframe

**Customer objection:** "We got no time to try new things"

**Jake's question:** "What are you trying to help them say instead?"

**Luca's insight (with Jake's push):** "The fallacy is they think improvement takes EXTRA time. Instead, it's about setting the right track - doesn't take more time to go in the right direction."

**Jake captures:** "Small steady changes compound over time. No big bang initiative. No hard negotiations with stakeholders. Just incremental momentum."

**Result:** Promise shifted from "give you time" to "work differently without disrupting workflow."
