# Client Tracking Requirements - Revenue Performance

**Date:** 2026-02-07  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Must track monthly for every client

## THE KEY METRIC: Revenue Growth & Time to Revenue Share

### What to Track (Monthly for Every Client):

1. **Current monthly revenue**
2. **Net new revenue since starting with GC**
3. **Payment status:** $6K flat fee OR 30% revenue share
4. **Time to revenue share:** How many months to break into revenue share territory

---

## Why This Matters (3 Critical Reasons):

### 1. **GC Only Wins in Revenue Share**
- We don't truly "win" until client is paying 30% of new revenue
- $6K flat fee = break-even, not profit maximization
- Revenue share = our upside, their success = our success

### 2. **Client is Paying Out of Pocket Until Revenue Share**
- **$6K/month phase:** Client pays from existing revenue/pocket (HURTS them)
- **Expense burden:** $6K is a real cost they feel every month
- **Goal:** Minimize time in this phase

### 3. **Revenue Share = Free Money for Client**
- **30% of NEW revenue:** Only paying from revenue they wouldn't have had without us
- **Doesn't cost them anything:** It's net new profit they're sharing
- **Pain-free payment:** No budget impact because it's incremental revenue

---

## What This Means Operationally:

**Time to Revenue Share = Our Performance Metric**

- Fast time to revenue share = We're effective
- Long time to revenue share = We need to improve
- Stuck at $6K/month = We're not delivering growth

**Break-even calculation:**
- Client needs to generate $20K/month in NEW revenue for 30% to exceed $6K
- $20K × 30% = $6K (break-even point)
- $20K+ × 30% = Revenue share territory ✅

## Master Client Tracking System Requirements:

### Must Track:
- [ ] Monthly revenue (current)
- [ ] Starting revenue (baseline when they signed)
- [ ] Net new revenue (current - baseline)
- [ ] Payment amount this month ($6K or 30% calculation)
- [ ] Payment type (flat fee or revenue share)
- [ ] Months since start
- [ ] Months to revenue share (if achieved)
- [ ] Revenue share status (not yet / achieved / maintaining)

### Dashboard Views Needed:
- [ ] Client list with revenue share status
- [ ] Average time to revenue share
- [ ] Total clients in flat fee vs revenue share
- [ ] Revenue growth trajectory per client
- [ ] Clients stuck in flat fee (red flag alert)

---

## Success Criteria:

**Ideal:** Client reaches revenue share within 3-6 months  
**Acceptable:** Within 6-12 months  
**Problem:** Still at $6K after 12+ months (investigate why)

---

## Simplified Summary:

**Track monthly for every client:**
1. How much revenue are they making?
2. How much MORE revenue since they started with us?
3. Are they paying $6K (out of pocket) or 30% (from new revenue)?
4. How long until they hit revenue share?

**Why it matters:**
- $6K/month = client paying out of pocket (hurts)
- 30% revenue share = client paying from new revenue we created (doesn't hurt)
- We only truly win when they're in revenue share territory
- Time to revenue share = our performance indicator

**Action:** Build this into master client tracking system and monitor monthly.
