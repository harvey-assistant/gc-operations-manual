## 💬 HOW TO USE IT

### Just Ask in Plain English

"Create a kickoff agenda for Type 2 client"
```

**The co-pilot will:**
1. Understand your situation
2. Pull from the right playbook
3. Customize guidance to your scenario
4. Provide checklists, scripts, examples
5. Suggest next steps

## 🎯 BEST PRACTICES

### 1. Be Specific

**Bad:** "Help with a call"  
**Good:** "Discovery call with accounting firm, 50 clients, wants community"

The more context you give, the better the guidance.

---

### 2. Ask Follow-Ups

**You:** "Discovery call prep?"  
**Co-pilot:** [Provides checklist]  
**You:** "Can you give me the exact script for the pricing conversation?"  
**Co-pilot:** [Provides script]

It's a conversation - ask as many questions as you need.

---

### 3. Share Transcripts

**Instead of:** Summarizing what happened  
**Do this:** Drop the Fathom link

Co-pilot can read transcripts and extract insights faster than you can explain.

---

### 4. Use It In Real-Time

**During calls:** "Client just objected to price - counter?"  
**During design:** "Need pricing framework NOW"  
**During kickoff:** "What question should I ask next?"

You don't have to wait - ask in the moment.

---

### 5. Request Custom Outputs

**You can ask for:**
- "Create a custom checklist for [scenario]"
- "Draft a follow-up email for [situation]"
- "Generate kickoff agenda for [client type]"
- "Write a pricing script for [objection]"

Co-pilot can create outputs, not just answer questions.

## 🎓 EXAMPLE CONVERSATIONS

### Example 1: Discovery Call Prep (Detailed)

```
YOU: "Discovery call with accounting firm owner tomorrow. 
      They have 50 clients, want to scale to 100."

COPILOT: "Type 1 client (existing business wanting to grow). 
          Let me prep you:

          BEFORE THE CALL:
          - [ ] Review their intake form
          - [ ] Pull up Realize as example (same vertical)
          - [ ] Prepare these questions:
            • 'How much revenue are you at now?'
            • 'What's stopping you from scaling?'
            • 'Have you tried building community before?'

          DURING THE CALL (30-45 min):
          1. Rapport (2 min) - [script]
          2. Discovery (15 min) - Let them talk
          3. Validation (2 min) - [script]
          4. Positioning (10 min) - Show Realize example
          5. Qualification (2 min) - Budget/timeline
          6. Soft close (1 min) - Book follow-up

          SIMILAR CLIENT: Realize (Jake Kessenich)
          - 500-member accounting community
          - Started same way (wanted to scale firm)
          - Now $75K/month revenue

          Ready? Need anything else?"

YOU: "Can you give me the exact validation script?"

COPILOT: "Validation script (after they explain situation):

          'That's really impressive - you're already in the top 
          10-20% just by having 50 clients. Most firms never get 
          past 20-30.'

          [pause for them to respond]

          'The fact that you're thinking about community shows 
          you're serious about scaling. You've figured out the 
          hardest part already - having clients who trust you.'

          This builds confidence and positions you as peer, not vendor.

          Want the positioning script next?"
```

---

### Example 2: Transcript Analysis

```
YOU: *drops Fathom link*
     "Just finished this call. What's next?"

COPILOT: *reads transcript in 30 seconds*

         "Key takeaways from call:

          CLIENT TYPE: Type 2 (building from scratch)
          CURRENT STATE: $500K revenue, no community yet
          GOAL: $2M in 2 years
          AUDIENCE: 10K email subscribers

          POSITIVE SIGNS:
          ✅ Clear transformation (help people get to $1M)
          ✅ Has audience already (10K emails)
          ✅ Budget aligned ($6K/month comfortable)

          RED FLAGS:
          ⚠️ Mentioned 'friend might co-lead' - not clear on authority
          ⚠️ Said 'maybe cohort or membership' - no clarity on format

          NEXT STEPS:
          1. Don't send contract yet (red flags to explore)
          2. Book follow-up call to clarify:
             • Who's the expert/authority?
             • Membership vs cohort decision
          3. If resolved → Proceed to Design phase

          FOLLOW-UP EMAIL (draft):
          'Hey [Name],

          Great talking today. Before we move forward, want to 
          clarify a couple things:

          1. Authority structure - You mentioned a friend might 
             co-lead. Can you tell me more about that?
          2. Format - Let's nail down membership vs cohort based 
             on your specific goals.

          Want to chat again [day/time]?'

          Want me to refine anything?"
```

---

### Example 3: Emergency Help

```
YOU: "Design session NOW. Client can't decide on pricing. 
      They want $150/month but worried no one will pay."

COPILOT: "Use stair-step approach (Alex Hormozi model):

          FRAMEWORK:
          - Start: $47-75 for first 50 people (founding members)
          - Then: Increase 10% every 50 members
          - Target: $150 after 3-4 cohorts

          SCRIPT FOR RIGHT NOW:
          'Here's what I'd suggest: Don't start at $150. 
          
          Start at $75 for your first 50 founding members. 
          This does three things:
          1. Validates people will pay
          2. Gets you revenue fast
          3. Creates FOMO (price going up)

          Then increase 10% every 50 members. By the time 
          you're at 200 members, you're at $150.

          Your founding members get locked in at $75 forever 
          as reward for being early.'

          REAL EXAMPLE: Luca (Refactoring)
          - Started at $75
          - Now climbing toward $100
          - Founding members locked at $75

          Try that script. Still stuck?"
```

---

## 🚫 WHAT IT DOESN'T DO

**Co-pilot boundaries:**
- ❌ Won't make commitments on behalf of team
- ❌ Won't send emails/messages for you
- ❌ Won't share specific pricing to clients
- ❌ Won't give legal/financial advice

**When it escalates to Jordan:**
- Truly unique situation (no playbook applies)
- Strategic decision outside normal scope
- Client red flags needing judgment call

## 🎯 POWER FEATURES

```
YOU: "Create custom checklist for:
      - Design session
      - Type 2 client
      - Experienced founder
      - 8-week launch timeline"

COPILOT: *generates custom checklist*
         [Checklist adjusted for scenario:
          - Skips basics (experienced founder)
          - Compresses timeline (8 weeks)
          - Focuses on Type 2 approach]
```

---

### Feature 2: Stay On During Calls

```
YOU: "Can you stay on during my discovery call? 
      Might need real-time help."

COPILOT: "Absolutely. Just @ me if you need anything during the call.
          I'll respond in seconds."

[During call]
YOU: "@copilot - they just said price is a concern"
COPILOT: "Use value-based frame: [script]"
```

---

### Feature 3: Progress Tracking

```
YOU: "Where are we with Austin Cohen?"

COPILOT: "Austin Cohen status:
          - Phase: Design (50% clear)
          - Last call: Nov 7 (design session pt 2)
          - Next: Customer validation calls (5-10 people)
          - Then: Build phase kickoff

          Need prep for next call?"
```

---

## 📊 MEASURING SUCCESS

**You're using it well if:**
- You ask 3-5+ questions per week
- You get answers in <2 minutes
- You execute confidently without Jordan
- Client work quality stays high

**You should use it more if:**
- You're still asking Jordan the same questions
- You're guessing at methodology
- You're spending 10+ min searching playbooks

---

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

**Problem:** Response not specific enough  
**Solution:** Give more context about your situation

**Problem:** Don't understand the guidance  
**Solution:** Ask follow-up: "Can you explain [X] more simply?"

**Problem:** Need something not in playbooks  
**Solution:** Co-pilot will escalate to Jordan automatically

**Problem:** Co-pilot seems off/wrong  
**Solution:** Flag it: "This doesn't seem right because [reason]"
