### 8-Phase Client Journey

```
SALES → ONBOARD → [AUDIT or DESIGN] → BUILD → LAUNCH → OPTIMIZE → GROW

## SALES PLAYBOOK

# SALES PLAYBOOK - Discovery Call Execution

**Use this when:** You have a discovery call with a potential client  
**Time needed:** 30-45 minutes  
**Goal:** Qualify fit, demonstrate value, book next step

---

## ⚡ 5-MINUTE OVERVIEW

**The Discovery Formula:**
1. **Rapport** (2 min) - Connect naturally
2. **Discovery** (15 min) - Let THEM talk, you listen
3. **Validation** (2 min) - Affirm what's working
4. **Positioning** (10 min) - Show visual examples
5. **Qualification** (2 min) - Check fit (budget, timeline, readiness)
6. **Soft Close** (1 min) - Book follow-up, no pressure

**Key principle:** You're evaluating THEM as much as they're evaluating you.

---

## 🌳 DECISION TREE: BEFORE THE CALL

```
START: Prospect booked discovery call
  ↓
PREP QUESTIONS:
├─ Do they have an audience/network? 
│  ├─ YES → Continue
│  └─ NO → Red flag (note for call)
│
├─ Are they the expert/authority?
│  ├─ YES → Continue
│  └─ NO → Red flag (may not be good fit)
│
├─ What's their current revenue model?
│  ├─ Existing business → Type 1 (Optimize & Grow)
│  └─ Starting new → Type 2 (Build from Scratch)
│
└─ Gather background:
   → Review intake form
   → Check their website/socials
   → Find 2-3 similar client examples to show
```

---

## ✅ PRE-CALL CHECKLIST

**Do this 1 hour before call:**
- [ ] Review their intake form/background
- [ ] Identify: Type 1 (optimize existing) or Type 2 (build new)?
- [ ] Find 2-3 relevant client examples to show
- [ ] Have comparison clients in mind (Exit Five, Realize, etc.)
- [ ] Clear 45 minutes, no distractions
- [ ] Screen share ready (Circle examples)
- [ ] Notebook ready to capture verbatim language

---

## 📞 DURING THE CALL: 6-STEP SEQUENCE

### STEP 1: RAPPORT (1-2 min)

**Goal:** Connection, ease, warmth

**Script:**
```
"Hey [Name]! How are you? Where are you calling from?"

[Natural conversation about their location, weather, etc.]

"Great energy - thanks for taking the time to chat."
```

**Don't:** Rush this. Let it be natural.

---

### STEP 2: DISCOVERY (15-20 min)

**Goal:** Let THEM explain everything - current state, goals, challenges

**Opening question (pick one):**
```
✅ "What was the main motivation behind reaching out?"
✅ "Walk me through what you're up to."
✅ "Fill me in - what's going on?"
```

**Then SHUT UP and listen for 10-15 minutes.**

**Follow-up questions (as needed):**
```
□ "Who's the community for and what are you helping them do?"
□ "How much are you charging them?"
□ "How many members do you have?"
□ "What would you say your biggest goals are?"
□ "Is this scale fast and sell in 12 months, or build to $200K/month?"
□ "What would be some of the biggest challenges you'd want to tackle?"
□ "What's working well right now?"
□ "What's not working?"
```

**Key principle:** Ask open-ended, let them show you everything. Don't jump to solutions yet.

**What to listen for:**
- [ ] Problems in their exact words (write these down verbatim)
- [ ] What they've tried before
- [ ] Why now? (timing/urgency)
- [ ] Budget signals
- [ ] Red flags (not the expert, no audience, etc.)

---

### STEP 3: VALIDATION (2-3 min)

**Goal:** Affirm what's working, build confidence, position as peer

**Validation phrases:**
```
✅ "You're killing it already"
✅ "You're in the top 10-20% just by [specific thing they're doing]"
✅ "That's really impressive - most people don't [X]"
✅ "You've figured out the hardest part already"
✅ "I appreciate that background - really helpful"
```

**Real example:**
> Jake (Realize): Built accounting community to 500 members, $75K/month
> Jordan: "You're killing it already. Most people never get past 100 members."

**Why this matters:** People come feeling inadequate. Validation opens them up.

---

### STEP 4: POSITIONING (10-15 min)

**Goal:** Show offering, demonstrate expertise, use visual examples

**Method: SHOW DON'T TELL**

**Step 4A: Share screen**
```
"Let me show you what we did with [similar client]."
```

**Step 4B: Pull up relevant example:**
- **Type 1 (Optimize):** Show Realize (Jake Kessenich) - 709 members, 80% active
- **Type 2 (Build new):** Show Exit Five (Dave Gerhardt) - 7-figure community
- **Other:** AI Finance Club, Ness Labs, depending on vertical

**Step 4C: Walk through 3-5 quick wins:**
```
"Here's what we'd do in the first 30 days..."
├─ Week 1: [Specific thing]
├─ Week 2: [Specific thing]
└─ Week 3: [Specific thing]
```

**Positioning phrases:**
```
✅ "Here's what we do..."
✅ "The way I think about it is..."
✅ "I've seen this work really well when..."
✅ "This is what [similar client] is doing - does this resonate?"
```

**Key principle:** Visual beats verbal. Show them a working example.

---

### STEP 5: QUALIFICATION (2-3 min)

**Goal:** Ensure fit - budget, timeline, readiness

**Qualification questions:**
```
□ "Does this sound like alignment with what you're looking for - budget, timeline?"
□ "Are you ready to move forward on something like this?"
□ "What would need to be true for this to be a no-brainer?"
```

**Budget discussion:**
```
"Our model is $6,000 a month or 30% of the new revenue we help you 
generate, whichever is greater. 

In the beginning, you'll be paying the $6K minimum while we're building. 
But our goal is to grow your revenue to the point where that 30% becomes 
more than $6K - because that means we're actually moving the needle. 

And at that point, you're only paying us out of revenue you wouldn't have 
had without us, so it becomes completely self-funding."
```

**Red flags to watch for:**
- [ ] Not the expert/authority in their space ⚠️
- [ ] No audience/network to start with ⚠️
- [ ] Not passionate about the topic ⚠️
- [ ] Budget concerns (can't afford $4K+/month) ⚠️
- [ ] Timeline mismatch ⚠️
- [ ] Unclear on their offer/who they serve ⚠️

**If 2+ red flags:** Politely decline or suggest different approach.

---

### STEP 6: SOFT CLOSE (1-2 min)

**Goal:** Book next step without pressure

**Closing script:**
```
"I think there's a lot we could do here. Want to continue this conversation?"

[If yes:]
"Great - let's book a follow-up for later this week. I'll send you a calendar link."

[If hesitant:]
"No pressure at all. Take some time to think about it, and let me know if you want to chat more."
```

**No hard close. No pressure. Just natural next step.**

---

## 📋 POST-CALL CHECKLIST

**Do this immediately after call:**
- [ ] Capture verbatim language for positioning (exact words they used)
- [ ] Note: Type 1 or Type 2?
- [ ] Book follow-up within 7 days (if qualified)
- [ ] Update CRM/notes with red flags or misalignment
- [ ] Send follow-up email within 24 hours

**Follow-up email template:**
```
Subject: Great chatting - next steps

Hey [Name],

Really enjoyed our conversation today. 

Quick recap of what we discussed:
- [Their main goal/problem in their words]
- [What we'd help them achieve]
- [Timeline/next steps]

Here's the calendar link to book our follow-up: [LINK]

Looking forward to continuing the conversation.

Jordan
```

---

## 🎯 KEY FRAMEWORKS TO USE

### 1. "Opera Singer Breaking Glass"
Use their EXACT words back to them. Visceral reaction.

**Example:**
- They say: "I want to break the million dollar mark"
- You say: "So the goal is to break that million dollar mark" (exact words)
- DON'T say: "grow your business" (generic)

### 2. Problems-First (Not Ideas-First)
Sequence: Problem → Who → Solution → Idea

**Example:**
- ❌ "I want to build a community for entrepreneurs"
- ✅ "Entrepreneurs are struggling with [specific problem]. I want to help them [specific outcome]."

### 3. Enemy Positioning
Define what you're NOT as important as what you ARE.

**Example:**
- Realize: "NOT general accounting community, FOR firm owners running $1M+ practices"

---

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

**Mistake 1: Talking too much**
- You should talk 40% max, them 60%+
- Solution: Ask open questions, then LISTEN

**Mistake 2: Jumping to solutions too fast**
- Let them fully explain before positioning
- Solution: Complete discovery BEFORE showing examples

**Mistake 3: Avoiding budget discussion**
- Awkward silence around pricing
- Solution: State pricing confidently, explain model clearly

**Mistake 4: Ignoring red flags**
- Signing clients who aren't good fit
- Solution: Politely decline if 2+ red flags present

**Mistake 5: No visual examples**
- Verbal descriptions don't land
- Solution: Always share screen, show working communities

---

## 📞 DURING THE CALL: 6-STEP SEQUENCE

### STEP 1: RAPPORT & CONTEXT (5-10 min)

**Goal:** Reconnect, celebrate milestone, set excited tone

**Opening script:**
```
"So it's exciting - we're finally doing this thing! We've been talking about 
it for a while, and I'm pumped we're officially kicking things off.

I'm confident we're going to get you to [their goal]. Let's dive in."
```

- [ ] Express confidence ("I'm confident we'll get there")
- [ ] Quick personal check-in (light, 2-3 min max)
- [ ] Set energy level (excited, optimistic)

**Real example (Austin Cohen kickoff):**
> "Excited to finally make this official, kick things off and start day one 
> of our founder community journey."

---

### STEP 2: SET EXPECTATIONS (10 min)

**Goal:** Orient to partnership model, iterative process, how you work

**Expectation-setting script:**
```
"A few things about how we work together:

1. PARTNERSHIP MODEL
   We're thought partners with you, a growth partner. Not just execution - 
   we're here to help you see things that are hard to see when you're inside 
   the jar.

2. PROVEN MODELS
   We've worked inside tons of different thought leader businesses, so we 
   bring proven models and patterns that work.

3. ITERATIVE PROCESS
   We don't try to figure everything out on day 1. We start at 10% clarity, 
   get to 50% over a few weeks, then refine to 99%. That's how we avoid 
   overwhelm and keep momentum.

4. WHERE WE HELP
   Two main areas: Offer side (positioning, pricing, structure) and 
   Technology/Systems side (Circle, automations, operations).

Make sense?"
```

**Key phrases to use:**
- "We're thought partners with you"
- "Help you see things hard to see from inside the jar"
- "Proven models from working with tons of thought leaders"
- "Iterative clarity: 10% → 50% → 99%"

---

### STEP 3: REVIEW INTAKE FORM (15-20 min)

**Goal:** Go through responses, ask clarifying questions, capture verbatim language

**Process:**
```
1. Pull up intake form on screen (share screen)
2. Go section by section
3. Ask follow-up questions
4. Capture exact words they use
5. Note any surprises vs. discovery call
```

**Key sections to review:**

**Business Fundamentals:**
```
□ "Walk me through your current revenue - what are the main sources?"
□ "Tell me about your team - who does what?"
□ "Audience size - email list, social following?"
```

**Community Goals:**
```
□ "Why build a community now? What's the timing?"
□ "What's the revenue target you're aiming for?"
□ "How many members would make this feel successful?"
□ "Timeline - when do you want to launch?"
```

**Current State:**
```
□ "Do you have an existing community? Where? How many?"
□ "What's working well right now?"
□ "What's not working or broken?"
```

**What to listen for:**
- [ ] Verbatim language (exact words for problems/goals)
- [ ] Key dates/events (launches, conferences)
- [ ] Resources (time, budget, team)
- [ ] Constraints (technical, timeline, capacity)

**Real example (Nicolas/AI Finance Club):**
> Nic mentioned "I want to break the million dollar mark in the next two years"
> Jordan captured exact phrase for use in positioning later

---

### STEP 4: DEFINE SUCCESS CRITERIA (10 min)

**Goal:** Crystal clear on what "winning" looks like

**Success questions:**
```
□ "What would make this a massive success 6 months from now?"
□ "What are the top 3 priorities you want us to tackle first?"
□ "What would you be celebrating if everything went perfectly?"
□ "What metrics matter most to you?"
□ "What would make you feel like this was worth the investment?"
```

**Capture:**
- [ ] North Star goal (big picture)
- [ ] Key dates/events (launches, conferences, milestones)
- [ ] Revenue targets (monthly/annual)
- [ ] Member/engagement goals
- [ ] Personal wins (time freedom, impact, etc.)

**Real example (Austin Cohen):**
> North Star: Launch premium founder community by Growth Summit (Feb 5)
> Key event: 75 chiropractors attending - major sales opportunity
> Timeline anchor: 3 months to build and launch

---

### STEP 5: PRESENT INITIAL DIRECTION (20-30 min)

**Goal:** Show you've already been thinking, give them something to react to

**The "10% Plan" Approach:**
```
"Okay, so I've already been thinking about your situation, and I want to 
give you some initial ideas to react to. This is maybe 10% baked - we're 
going to refine this a ton over the next few weeks.

But I find it's way easier for you to react and say 'yes, that' or 'no, not 
that' than to start from a blank page. So let me show you what I'm thinking..."
```

**What to present:**

**A. Initial positioning angle:**
```
"Based on what you've told me, here's how I'm thinking about positioning:

WHO: [Their exact target audience]
PROBLEM: [Their exact problem in customer words]
PROMISE: [What you help them achieve]
ENEMY: [What you're NOT]

Does that resonate, or am I off?"
```

**B. Quick wins you see:**
```
"Here are 3-5 quick wins I think we can hit in the first 30 days:
1. [Specific thing]
2. [Specific thing]
3. [Specific thing]"
```

**C. Rough roadmap:**
```
"Here's what I'm thinking for the next 90 days:

MONTH 1: Strategy & Design
- Week 1-2: Nail positioning and offer
- Week 3-4: Customer validation calls

MONTH 2: Build & Test
- Week 5-6: Circle setup
- Week 7-8: Content seeding

MONTH 3: Launch & Iterate
- Week 9-10: Beta launch
- Week 11-12: Iterate based on feedback

Does that timeline feel right?"
```

**D. Similar client examples:**
```
"Let me show you [similar client] - this is what we built with them."
[Share screen, show Circle space, explain approach]
"Does this feel like the right direction for you?"
```

**Key principle:**
- React and refine > blank page
- Show you understand their situation
- Make them feel like you're already working
- Permission to change everything

---

### STEP 6: ESTABLISH CADENCE & NEXT STEPS (5-10 min)

**Goal:** Set rhythm, create momentum, book next meeting

**Cadence script:**
```
"Okay, here's how we'll work together:

WEEKLY SYNCS:
- 60-minute calls, same day/time each week
- [Propose day/time based on their availability]

COMMUNICATION:
- Slack for quick stuff (or email if they prefer)
- You'll have direct access to me, Filip, and Shannon

TEAM:
- Jordan: Strategy and big picture
- Filip: Technical implementation and operations
- Shannon: Project management and tactical execution

NEXT MEETING:
Let's book next week - [propose specific date/time]

Between now and then:
- YOU: [Specific deliverable if needed]
- US: [What we'll prepare - usually initial strategy brief]

Sound good?"
```

**What to establish:**
- [ ] Weekly sync day/time (lock it in recurring)
- [ ] Communication channel (Slack/email)
- [ ] Team roles clarified
- [ ] Next meeting booked (within 7 days)
- [ ] Clear homework/deliverables

**Typical first-month rhythm:**
```
Week 1: Kickoff (this call) → Strategy brief drafted
Week 2: Review strategy brief → 10% plan
Week 3: Deep dive on offer → 50% plan
Week 4: Customer validation → 99% plan
```

---

## 🔑 KEY FRAMEWORKS

### 1. Iterative Clarity Model (10% → 50% → 99%)

**Concept:** Don't try to figure everything out on day 1

**10% Clear (Week 1):**
- Initial direction from kickoff
- Rough ideas to react to
- Obvious quick wins identified
- Priorities set for next 2 weeks

**50% Clear (Weeks 2-3):**
- Deeper dives on offer/positioning
- Customer validation starting
- Refining based on feedback
- Clearer roadmap emerging

**99% Clear (Weeks 4-6):**
- Customer research complete
- Final offer locked in
- Detailed 90-day plan
- Confidence to execute

**Why this works:**
- Reduces overwhelm
- Creates fast momentum
- Allows course correction
- Builds confidence through iteration

**Script to explain:**
```
"We're not going to try to nail everything today. We start at 10% clarity - 
enough to move forward. Then we get to 50% over a few weeks. Then we refine 
to 99% before we execute. That way we're never stuck, never overwhelmed, and 
we can course-correct as we learn."
```

---

### 2. React and Refine (Not Blank Page)

**Concept:** Give them something to react to, don't start from scratch

**Why this works:**
- Faster decision-making
- Shows you're already thinking
- Reduces decision fatigue
- Demonstrates expertise

**Script:**
```
"I've taken some liberties here and come with ideas. You might hate all of 
it - that's totally fine. It's way easier for us to edit and refine than to 
start from a blank page. So react honestly - tell me what resonates and what 
doesn't."
```

---

### 3. Type 1 vs Type 2 Path

**Type 1 (Optimize & Grow):**
- They have existing community
- Start with AUDIT phase
- Focus: Fix what's broken, scale what works
- Examples: Realize, AI Finance Club

**Type 2 (Build from Scratch):**
- Starting new community
- Start with DESIGN phase
- Focus: Positioning, offer, pricing
- Examples: Austin Cohen, Anne-Laure

**Kickoff differences:**

| Aspect | Type 1 (Optimize) | Type 2 (Build) |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| **First priority** | Audit current state | Design offer |
| **Week 1 focus** | What's working/broken | Who/what/how much |
| **Quick wins** | Fix friction points | Validate positioning |
| **Timeline** | Faster (existing base) | Slower (building from zero) |

- Reviewed current revenue model
- Identified pricing and retention as top priorities
- Presented Exit Five as revenue benchmark

**Outcome:** Clear path to 2x revenue

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

**Mistake 1: Blank page syndrome**
- Don't ask "What do you want to do?"
- Solution: Come with 10% plan for them to react to

**Mistake 2: Trying to nail everything on day 1**
- Overwhelming client with too much detail
- Solution: Use 10% → 50% → 99% model

**Mistake 3: No clear next steps**
- Kickoff ends without concrete actions
- Solution: Book next meeting NOW, assign homework

**Mistake 4: Not establishing rhythm**
- No recurring sync scheduled
- Solution: Lock in weekly cadence before call ends

**Mistake 5: Missing intake form review**
- Jumping straight to ideas without context
- Solution: Always review intake together

## 📋 FORMAT 1: ITERATIVE DESIGN (Jordan Model)

### Overview
- **Who runs:** Jordan typically
- **Sessions:** 3-4 calls over 2 weeks (30-60 min each)
- **Best for:** Clients who need conversational clarity
- **Example:** Austin Cohen Nov 7 sessions

### Session 1: Outcomes Clarification (10% Clear)

**Goal:** Get crystal clear on transformation you're selling

**Prep:**
- [ ] Review kickoff notes
- [ ] Review intake form outcomes
- [ ] Prepare clarifying questions

**Opening:**
```
"Last time we talked about these outcomes: [list them]. Let's dig into these 
and make sure we're clear on what transformation we're really selling."
```

**Key questions:**
```
□ "What outcomes matter MOST to your people?"
□ "Which outcome would sell the most seats?"
□ "What transformation do they want most?"
□ "What are they trying to avoid?"
□ "What's the gap between where they are and where they want to be?"
□ "What are they currently doing that doesn't work?"
```

**Listen for:**
- [ ] Verbatim customer language
- [ ] What they're ESCAPING (enemy positioning)
- [ ] Quantifiable gaps (numbers, metrics)
- [ ] Conflicts between outcomes

**Output:**
- [ ] Top 3 outcomes prioritized
- [ ] Transformation statement drafted
- [ ] Enemy positioning identified

**Real example (Austin Cohen):**
> Initial: "Help chiropractors scale to $1M"
> Refined: "Help 250-300K/year chiropractors hit 50K/month WITHOUT diluting 
> services or selling their soul"

---

### Session 2: Target Audience Definition (50% Clear)

**Goal:** Define WHO specifically you're serving

**Prep:**
- [ ] Review session 1 notes
- [ ] Draft initial avatar based on their language

**Opening:**
```
"Okay, we know the transformation. Now let's get super specific on WHO this 
is for. Paint me a picture of the ideal person."
```

**Key questions:**
```
□ "Who exactly is this for?"
□ "What's their current revenue/size?"
□ "Where do they want to be?"
□ "What have they already tried?"
□ "What are they frustrated with?"
□ "What makes someone ready vs. not ready?"
```

**Framework: Current State → Desired State**
```
CURRENT STATE:
- Revenue: [specific range]
- Problem: [in their words]
- Failed solutions: [what didn't work]
- Frustration: [exact language]

DESIRED STATE:
- Revenue: [target]
- Transformation: [what changes]
- Success looks like: [specific outcomes]
- Timeline: [how fast]
```

**Output:**
- [ ] Current state defined (with numbers)
- [ ] Desired state defined (with numbers)
- [ ] Gap quantified
- [ ] Avatar documented in their language

**Real example (Austin Cohen):**
> **Current:** $25-35K/month chiropractors stuck at plateau
> **Desired:** $50K/month without services dilution
> **Gap:** "Most will never get past 300K/year mark"

---

### Session 3: Offer Structure + Pricing (99% Clear)

**Goal:** Define what you're selling and how much

**Prep:**
- [ ] Review sessions 1-2 notes
- [ ] Draft 2-3 offer structure options
- [ ] Research comparable pricing

**Opening:**
```
"We know WHO and WHAT transformation. Now let's figure out the HOW - what 
format serves this best, and what's the right price point."
```

**Offer structure questions:**
```
□ "What format best delivers this transformation?"
   └─ Membership? Cohort? Hybrid?

□ "What's included? What's NOT included?"
   └─ Content? Community? Coaching? Events?

□ "What's the time commitment for members?"
   └─ How much time can they realistically invest?

□ "What makes this different from alternatives?"
   └─ What are they escaping?
```

**Pricing methodology:**

**Step 1: Outcome-based pricing**
```
"What's the VALUE of the transformation?"

Example: $50K/month = $600K/year
If membership helps them get there, what % of that value is fair?
→ Even 1% = $6,000/year = $500/month

Frame: "What would you pay to reliably hit $50K/month?"
```

**Step 2: Stair-step approach (Alex Hormozi model)**
```
START LOW:
- First 10-50 people: $47-75/month (founding member pricing)
- Validate demand, get testimonials, iron out kinks

INCREASE GRADUALLY:
- Next 50: Increase 10% → $52-83/month
- Next 50: Increase 10% → $57-91/month
- Next 50: Increase 10% → $63-100/month

RATIONALE:
- Early adopters take risk → rewarded with lower price
- Increased confidence → justified price increases
- Creates FOMO (price goes up soon)
```

**Step 3: Personal budget threshold**
```
SWEET SPOT: <$100/month
- Doesn't require spouse approval
- Can expense or pay personally
- "Impulse buy" territory for professionals

DANGER ZONE: >$150/month
- Requires justification
- Higher churn risk
- Harder sell
```

**Output:**
- [ ] Offer format decided
- [ ] Deliverables defined
- [ ] Pricing validated
- [ ] Positioning locked

**Real example (Luca Feb 4):**
> **Offer:** Membership (not cohort)
> **Deliverables:** Weekly content drops, community, quarterly live events
> **Pricing:** $47-75/month start, stair-step to $100
> **Positioning:** "Make your team ship faster" (not "grow your career")

---

### Session 4: Validation + Finalization

**Goal:** Test with real customers, lock in final decisions

**Prep:**
- [ ] Draft messaging for testing
- [ ] Identify 5-10 people to validate with

**Process:**
```
1. Reach out to 5-10 ideal customers
2. Pitch the transformation (not features)
3. Ask: "Would you pay $X/month for this?"
4. Listen for objections
5. Refine based on feedback
```

**Validation script:**
```
"Hey [Name], quick question:

I'm working on [transformation statement] for [target avatar]. 

The format is [offer structure], and it's $X/month.

Honest feedback: Would this be valuable to you? Any hesitations?"
```

**What to listen for:**
- [ ] Price objections (too high? too low?)
- [ ] Format objections (wrong delivery method?)
- [ ] Transformation objections (not the right outcome?)
- [ ] Timing objections (not ready? urgency missing?)

**Output:**
- [ ] Final pricing confirmed
- [ ] Messaging refined based on objections
- [ ] 2-5 early commitments (ideally)
- [ ] Green light to BUILD phase

---

## 📋 FORMAT 2: STRUCTURED WORKSHOP (Filip Model)

### Overview
- **Who runs:** Filip (or Jordan)
- **Duration:** 90 minutes intensive
- **Best for:** Experienced clients who respond to frameworks
- **Example:** Luca Rossi Feb 4 workshop

### Workshop Structure

**Prep (30 min before):**
- [ ] Review kickoff notes
- [ ] Prepare empathy mapping canvas
- [ ] Have framework slides ready

**Section 1: Empathy Mapping (30 min)**

**Framework: SAY → THINK → FEEL → DO** (Jake Wysocki method)

```
QUADRANT 1: WHAT DO THEY SAY?
"What words do your ideal customers use to describe their problem?"
[Capture exact phrases, verbatim language]

QUADRANT 2: WHAT DO THEY THINK?
"What's going through their head? Internal dialogue?"
[Deeper beliefs, assumptions, fears]

QUADRANT 3: WHAT DO THEY FEEL?
"What emotions are they experiencing?"
[Frustration, anxiety, hope, desperation]

QUADRANT 4: WHAT DO THEY DO?
"What actions are they taking (or not taking)?"
[Behaviors, workarounds, failed solutions]
```

**Output:**
- [ ] Empathy map completed
- [ ] Customer language captured
- [ ] Problem deeply understood

---

**Section 2: Promise Statement Refinement (30 min)**

**Jake Wysocki's "Brain on Speakerphone" method:**

```
STEP 1: Write initial promise
"We help [WHO] achieve [WHAT]"

STEP 2: Make thinking visible
- What assumptions am I making?
- What am I taking for granted?
- What needs to be more specific?

STEP 3: Refine based on questions
- Is WHO specific enough?
- Is WHAT quantifiable?
- Is this believable?
- Does it differentiate from alternatives?

STEP 4: Test for clarity
"If I told this to an ideal customer, would they immediately say 
'That's exactly what I need'?"
```

**Real example (Luca workshop):**
> Initial: "Help engineering managers be better leaders"
> Refined: "Make your team ship faster" (outcome-focused, quantifiable)

**Output:**
- [ ] Promise statement refined
- [ ] Customer reaction tested
- [ ] Differentiation clear

---

**Section 3: Offer Design + Pricing (30 min)**

**Use WHO → PROBLEMS → PROMISE → DELIVERABLES → PRICING sequence:**

```
WHO: [From empathy map]
PROBLEMS: [From empathy map]
PROMISE: [From refinement]

DELIVERABLES:
- What do they need to achieve the promise?
- What's the minimum viable offer?
- What's nice-to-have vs. must-have?

PRICING:
- Outcome value calculation
- Stair-step approach (start low, increase)
- Personal budget threshold (<$100/month)
```

**Output:**
- [ ] Offer structure decided
- [ ] Deliverables prioritized
- [ ] Pricing validated
- [ ] Next steps clear

---

## 📋 FORMAT 3: STRATEGY BRIEF (Async Model)

### Overview
- **Who runs:** Jordan drafts, client reviews
- **Duration:** 1-2 days draft, 1 hour review call
- **Best for:** Strategic thinkers who prefer solo work
- **Example:** Anne-Laure Jan 20 brief

### Process

**Step 1: Draft Strategy Brief (Jordan)**

**Brief structure:**
```markdown
# [CLIENT NAME] STRATEGY BRIEF

## CURRENT STATE
- Business overview
- Audience size/makeup
- Revenue model
- What's working
- What's broken

## GOALS
- North Star (big picture)
- 6-month targets (specific)
- Key metrics (what we measure)

## POSITIONING
- WHO (target avatar)
- WHAT (transformation promise)
- HOW (offer structure)
- WHY NOW (timing/urgency)
- ENEMY (what we're NOT)

## OFFER STRUCTURE
- Format (membership/cohort/hybrid)
- Deliverables (what's included)
- Pricing (with rationale)
- Launch timeline

## NEXT 90 DAYS
- Month 1: [Focus areas]
- Month 2: [Focus areas]
- Month 3: [Focus areas]

## OPEN QUESTIONS
- [What needs client input]
- [Areas of uncertainty]
- [Decisions to make]
```

**Drafting time:** 2-4 hours

---

**Step 2: Client Review (Async)**

Send brief with this framing:
```
"I've drafted a strategy brief based on our kickoff. This is 50% baked - 
there's a bunch I got right, and probably a bunch I got wrong.

Read through it and mark up anything that doesn't feel right. I'd rather 
you tear it apart now than nod along and regret it later.

Let's schedule a call for [date/time] to walk through your feedback."
```

**Client marks up:**
- [ ] What resonates
- [ ] What's off
- [ ] What's missing
- [ ] Questions/concerns

---

**Step 3: Review Call (60 min)**

**Agenda:**
```
1. What resonated (5 min)
2. What felt off (15 min)
3. What's missing (10 min)
4. Refine together (20 min)
5. Lock in decisions (10 min)
```

**Output:**
- [ ] Final strategy brief
- [ ] All decisions locked
- [ ] Green light to BUILD phase

---

## 🔑 KEY FRAMEWORKS (Jake Wysocki Design Thinking)

### 1. Empathy Mapping (SAY/THINK/FEEL/DO)

**Purpose:** Deeply understand customer beyond surface problem

```
┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
│  SAY        │  THINK      │
│  (external) │  (internal) │
├─────────────┼─────────────┤
│  FEEL       │  DO         │
│  (emotions) │  (actions)  │
└─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

**Use when:** Need to get beyond stated problem to real need

---

### 2. "Brain on Speakerphone"

**Purpose:** Make invisible thinking visible, surface assumptions

**Method:**
```
1. Make a claim/statement
2. Ask: "What am I assuming here?"
3. Test: "Is that assumption valid?"
4. Refine: "What would make this more accurate?"
5. Repeat until clear
```

**Use when:** Positioning feels vague or generic

---

### 3. Promise Statement Refinement

**Purpose:** Create clear, compelling transformation promise

**Format:**
```
"We help [WHO] achieve [WHAT] without [ENEMY]"

WHERE:
- WHO = Specific current state avatar
- WHAT = Quantifiable desired state
- ENEMY = What they're escaping/avoiding
```

**Test:**
- [ ] Would ideal customer immediately say "That's me!"?
- [ ] Is it differentiated from alternatives?
- [ ] Is transformation quantifiable?
- [ ] Is it believable?

---

### 4. Stair-Step Pricing (Alex Hormozi)

**Purpose:** Start low, validate, increase as confidence grows

```
FOUNDING MEMBERS (First 10-50):
→ $47-75/month
→ Take most risk, get best deal

COHORT 2 (Next 50):
→ Increase 10% → $52-83/month
→ Social proof now exists

COHORT 3 (Next 50):
→ Increase 10% → $57-91/month
→ Proven model, testimonials

TARGET STEADY STATE:
→ $97-150/month
→ After 3-4 cohorts, settle here
```

**Rationale:**
- Early adopters rewarded for risk
- Price increases create FOMO
- Incremental validation builds confidence
- Can always adjust based on market response

---

## 📊 DESIGN PHASE OUTPUTS (Checklist)

**By end of design phase, must have:**
- [ ] **Target Avatar:** Current state → Desired state (with numbers)
- [ ] **Transformation Promise:** One-sentence clear statement
- [ ] **Offer Structure:** Format decided (membership/cohort/hybrid)
- [ ] **Deliverables:** What's included, what's not
- [ ] **Pricing:** Validated with rationale
- [ ] **Positioning:** WHO/WHAT/HOW/ENEMY all clear
- [ ] **90-day Roadmap:** Month-by-month plan
- [ ] **Customer Validation:** 2-5 people saying "I'd buy this"

**If ANY of these missing:** Don't move to BUILD phase yet.

---

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

**Mistake 1: Trying to nail everything in one session**
- Design takes 3-4 weeks for a reason
- Solution: Use 10% → 50% → 99% model

**Mistake 2: Skipping customer validation**
- Designing in isolation without real feedback
- Solution: Always validate with 5-10 real customers

**Mistake 3: Generic positioning**
- "Help entrepreneurs grow their business"
- Solution: Use verbatim customer language, quantify gaps

**Mistake 4: Pricing based on costs (not value)**
- "I need to charge $X to cover my costs"
- Solution: Price on outcome value, not your expenses

**Mistake 5: Wrong format for client**
- Using workshop for someone who needs hand-holding
- Solution: Match format to client's style

## BUILD PLAYBOOK

# BUILD PLAYBOOK - Implementation & Pre-Sell Execution

**Use this when:** Design phase complete, ready to implement  
**Time needed:** 4-6 weeks  
**Goal:** Functioning Circle space + 5-10 founding members

---

## ⚡ 5-MINUTE OVERVIEW

**The Pre-Sell Methodology (NOT Build → Sell):**
1. **Reach out** to 5-10 ideal members (don't build yet)
2. **Sell on outcome** via serve calls (not features)
3. **Get money** + hear objections
4. **Build based on feedback** (what they actually need)

**Why this works:**
- Validates demand BEFORE building
- Surfaces real objections early
- Builds WITH customers, not FOR them
- Faster to revenue

**Key principle:** "You sell 100x better on a serve call than any sales page."

---

## 🌳 DECISION TREE: BUILD APPROACH

```
START: Design complete, ready to build
  ↓
DO YOU HAVE EXISTING AUDIENCE?
├─ YES: Pre-sell approach
│  ├─ Reach out to 5-10 ideal people
│  ├─ Serve calls (sell on outcome)
│  ├─ Get money FIRST
│  └─ Build WITH their input
│
└─ NO: Need to build + market
   ├─ Build minimum viable Circle
   ├─ Seed with basic content
   ├─ Launch to cold audience
   └─ Iterate based on feedback

RECOMMENDED: Pre-sell whenever possible (faster, validated)
```

---

## ✅ PRE-BUILD CHECKLIST

**Design outputs confirmed:**
- [ ] Promise statement locked
- [ ] Target avatar defined
- [ ] Pricing validated
- [ ] Deliverables clear
- [ ] Positioning finalized

**Ready to build:**
- [ ] Circle account created
- [ ] Payment processor connected
- [ ] List of 5-10 ideal beta members identified
- [ ] Team roles assigned (who builds what)

---

## 📞 PHASE 1: PRE-SELL (Week 1-2)

### Step 1: Identify Beta Candidates

**Who to reach out to:**
- [ ] People who've expressed interest
- [ ] Warm network (know/like/trust you)
- [ ] Ideal avatar match
- [ ] Can afford pricing
- [ ] Will give honest feedback

**How many:** 5-10 people (not 50)

**Why this number:**
- Small enough to serve personally
- Large enough to validate demand
- Can handle on serve calls
- Won't overwhelm you

---

### Step 2: Reach Out (Conversation-Based)

**Method:** Direct message, not mass email

**Outreach template:**
```
Hey [Name],

Quick question: I'm launching [transformation promise] for [target avatar].

It's [format] at [price]/month, starting [date].

Would this be valuable to you? Want to jump on a quick call to talk through it?

[Your Name]
```

**Key elements:**
- Personal (not blast)
- Specific (transformation, not features)
- Low commitment ask (call, not "buy now")
- Timing clear

**Real example (Austin):**
> Reached out to 5-10 chiropractors from Growth Summit
> "I'm helping 25-35K/month practices hit 50K WITHOUT diluting services. 
> Want to chat?"

---

### Step 3: Serve Calls (NOT Sales Calls)

**Goal:** Understand their problem, show how you'd solve it, handle objections, get commitment

**Serve call structure (30-45 min):**

**1. Discovery (10 min):**
```
"Tell me about your situation. Where are you at right now with [specific goal]?"

[Listen, take notes, capture exact language]
```

**2. Positioning (15 min):**
```
"Okay, here's what I'm thinking. I'd help you [transformation] by:
- [Deliverable 1]
- [Deliverable 2]
- [Deliverable 3]

The format is [membership/cohort], and it's [price]/month.

Does that sound like it would help?"
```

**3. Objection handling (10 min):**
```
"What concerns do you have? What would need to be true for this to be a 
no-brainer?"

[Address objections one at a time]
```

**4. Close (5 min):**
```
"So, are you in? Can I count you as one of the founding members?"

[If yes:]
"Awesome. I'll send you a payment link today. We start [date]."
```

**Key principle:** Handle objections ONE AT A TIME, move toward decision.

**Real example (Jordan's approach):**
> "You sell 100x better than a sales page. Get on calls, hear objections 
> live, adjust positioning real-time."

---

### Step 4: Get Money (Payment BEFORE Build)

**Don't:** Wait to build before charging

**Do:** Get payment, THEN build based on their input

**Payment setup:**
- [ ] Create Circle paywall link (simple)
- [ ] Set founding member price
- [ ] Send link after serve call
- [ ] Collect payment

**Why money first:**
- Validates real commitment (not just interest)
- Gives you runway to build properly
- Makes them invested in success
- Surfaces serious objections vs. polite interest

**Script:**
```
"Great! I'm sending you the payment link now. Once you're in, I'll add you 
to the founding member group where we'll co-create this together."
```

---

### Step 5: Capture Objections & Feedback

**After each serve call, document:**
- [ ] What objections came up?
- [ ] What pricing concerns?
- [ ] What format questions?
- [ ] What deliverables did they ask about?
- [ ] What language resonated?
- [ ] What didn't land?

**Use this to refine:**
- Positioning
- Pricing
- Deliverables
- Messaging

**Pattern:** Build based on REAL feedback, not assumptions.

---

## 🏗️ PHASE 2: MINIMAL VIABLE BUILD (Week 3-4)

### Goal: Build just enough to start

**Don't build:**
- ❌ Perfect landing page
- ❌ 100 pieces of content
- ❌ Complex automation
- ❌ Every feature you dreamed of

**Do build:**
- ✅ Simple Circle space structure
- ✅ Clear onboarding sequence
- ✅ First week of content
- ✅ Event calendar (first month)
- ✅ Simple payment link

---

### Step 1: Circle Space Structure

**Keep it simple:**
```
SPACES (3-5 max to start):
├─ 📌 START HERE (Onboarding + announcements)
├─ 💬 COMMUNITY (General discussion)
├─ 📚 RESOURCES (Content library)
├─ 📅 EVENTS (Calendar + recordings)
└─ ❓ SUPPORT (Q&A, help)
```

**Don't overthink categories.** You can change them later.

**Real example (Austin):**
> Jordan: "Don't worry about the perfect names. You can change them based on 
> what your members actually need."

---

### Step 2: Seed Content (Just Enough)

**What to seed:**
- [ ] Welcome video (3-5 min)
- [ ] First week of core content (3-5 posts)
- [ ] FAQ post (common questions)
- [ ] Member intro template

**Don't:** Create 3 months of content up front

**Do:** Create 1 week, add more as you go

**Why:** 
- Content needs will change based on members
- Better to iterate than pre-build wrong stuff
- Founding members expect beta experience

---

### Step 3: Event Calendar (First Month Only)

**What to schedule:**
- [ ] Welcome call (week 1)
- [ ] Weekly live session (format TBD)
- [ ] Office hours (optional)
- [ ] Next month placeholder

**Don't:** Build 6-month calendar up front

**Do:** Schedule first month, add as you learn what works

**Pattern:** Work happens ON calls (not homework)

**Real insight (Jordan):**
> "15 minutes teaching, 75 minutes doing work together. Execution happens 
> live with immediate help. Members get tangible progress each session."

---

### Step 4: Simple Payment Setup

**Use Circle paywall link (easiest):**
```
1. Circle → Settings → Payments
2. Create membership tier
3. Set founding member price
4. Generate paywall link
5. Send to beta members
```

**Don't:** Build Stripe integration, custom checkout, fancy landing page

**Do:** Use Circle's native payment (fast, simple, works)

---

## 👥 PHASE 3: OPERATIONAL SETUP (Week 5-6)

### Step 1: Define Team Roles

**Who does what:**
```
JORDAN (Strategy):
- Client relationship
- Big picture direction
- Complex problem-solving

FILIP (Technical):
- Circle implementation

```

**Document for client's team:**
```
CLIENT (Expert):
- Content creation
- Live teaching/facilitation
- Community presence

COMMUNITY MANAGER (if hired):
- Daily engagement
- Member onboarding
- Event logistics
```

---

### Step 2: Onboarding Sequence

**What new members experience:**
```
DAY 1:
- Receive welcome email
- Access Circle space
- See "Start Here" pinned post
- Invited to welcome call

WEEK 1:
- Attend welcome call
- Complete profile
- Intro post in community

- [ ] Profile setup guidance
- [ ] Weekly rhythm explained

---

### Step 3: Engagement Loops

**What keeps members active:**

**Daily:**
- [ ] Community manager posts prompts
- [ ] Expert/founder responds to questions
- [ ] Members tagged for contributions

**Weekly:**
- [ ] Live session (teaching + execution)
- [ ] Recap/highlights posted
- [ ] Next week preview

**Monthly:**
- [ ] Special event/guest
- [ ] Member spotlight
- [ ] Progress check-in

**Build the minimum loops, iterate based on engagement.**

---

## 🔄 PHASE 4: LAUNCH & ITERATE (Week 7-8)

### Step 1: Beta Launch (Founding Members Only)

**Announce launch:**
```
"We're live! Founding members get access today. Here's what to expect:

WEEK 1:
- Welcome call [date/time]
- First live session [date/time]
- Daily check-ins in community

THIS IS BETA:
- Things will evolve
- Your feedback shapes everything
- Founding member pricing locked forever

Let's build this together."
```

---

### Step 2: Work ON Calls (Not Homework)

**Format for live sessions:**
```
MINUTE 0-15: Teaching
- Introduce concept/framework
- Show examples
- Answer clarifying questions

MINUTE 15-90: Doing
- Members work on their actual business/problem
- You circulate and help
- Screen share, live coaching
- Tangible progress by end
```

**Why this works:**
- Immediate help when stuck
- Accountability to execute
- Real progress (not just learning)
- Community sees each other's work

**Real example (Jordan):**
> "We don't give homework. We do the work together on the call. You get 
> 15 minutes of teaching, then 75 minutes of execution with help. Way more 
> valuable than 'go do this and come back next week.'"

---

### Step 3: Iterate Based on Feedback

**After each session, ask:**
- [ ] What worked well?
- [ ] What didn't work?
- [ ] What would you change?
- [ ] What's missing?

**Adjust quickly:**
- Content format
- Event timing
- Deliverables
- Engagement approach

**Pattern:** Beta = permission to iterate fast

---

## 🔑 KEY FRAMEWORKS

### 1. Pre-Sell Methodology (GrowthCommunity Standard)

**Sequence:**
```
TRADITIONAL (Wrong):
Build → Launch → Sell → Iterate
↓
PROBLEMS:
- Built wrong thing
- No validation
- Wasted time/money
- Hard to pivot

GROWTHCOMMUNITY (Right):
Reach out → Sell → Build → Iterate
↓
BENEFITS:
- Validated demand
- Real objections surfaced
- Built with customers
- Faster to revenue
```

---

### 2. Serve Calls > Landing Pages

**Concept:** Sell via conversation, not sales page

**Why:**
- You sell 100x better than copy
- Can handle objections live
- Adjust positioning real-time
- Build relationship immediately

**When to use sales page:**
- After 20-30 serve calls (you know all objections)
- Scaling beyond your call capacity
- Inbound leads from content

**For beta:** Always start with serve calls.

---

### 3. Work ON Calls (Execution Model)

**Concept:** Don't assign homework, do work together

**Format:**
- 15 min teaching
- 75 min doing (together)
- Immediate help when stuck
- Tangible progress each session

**Why this works:**
- Accountability (they actually do it)
- Momentum (progress every week)
- Community (see each other work)
- Value (help when they need it)

---

### 4. Network vs. Transformation Model

**Two approaches:**

**Transformation Model:**
- Specific outcome (lose 20 lbs, launch business)
- Members "graduate" after achieving
- High churn by design
- Content/education focused

**Network Model:**
- Ongoing access to peers/experts
- No "graduation"
- Lower churn potential
- Connection/resources focused

**Decision:** Which fits your offer?

---

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

**Mistake 1: Building before validating**
- Spend 6 weeks building, nobody buys
- Solution: Pre-sell FIRST, build SECOND

**Mistake 2: Perfect landing page syndrome**
- Obsess over copy/design instead of selling
- Solution: Use Circle paywall link, serve calls only

**Mistake 3: Creating too much content up front**
- 100 posts nobody asked for
- Solution: Seed 1 week, add based on needs

**Mistake 4: Homework instead of execution**
- "Go do this and report back"
- Solution: Work ON calls with immediate help

**Mistake 5: Complex automation too early**
- Fancy workflows before knowing what works
- Solution: Manual first, automate later

---

## 📋 BUILD PHASE OUTPUTS (Checklist)

**By end of build phase, must have:**
- [ ] **5-10 paying founding members**
- [ ] **Circle space configured** (3-5 spaces minimum)
- [ ] **First week content seeded**
- [ ] **Event calendar** (first month scheduled)
- [ ] **Team roles documented**
- [ ] **Onboarding sequence built**
- [ ] **Payment link working**
- [ ] **Engagement loops defined**

**If ANY of these missing:** Don't move to LAUNCH phase yet.

---

## 🔄 DECISION TREE: AFTER BUILD PHASE

```
BUILD PHASE COMPLETED
  ↓
DO YOU HAVE 5-10 PAYING MEMBERS?
  ├─ YES: Ready for full launch
  │   ↓
  │   GO TO: launch.md playbook
  │
  └─ NO: Need more validation
      ↓
      More serve calls
      Refine positioning
      Address objections
      Get to 5-10 before launching
```

## LAUNCH PLAYBOOK

# LAUNCH PLAYBOOK - Go-Live Execution

**Use this when:** Build complete, ready to open gates  
**Time needed:** 1 week launch + 2 weeks iteration  
**Goal:** Smooth first-week experience, momentum established

---

## ⚡ 5-MINUTE OVERVIEW

**Launch Philosophy:**
Balance momentum vs friction - let them in fast, but capture critical data.

**Launch Week Timeline:**
- **Day 1:** Gates open, members hit onboarding
- **Day 2-3:** First onboarding calls
- **Day 4-5:** First live sessions
- **Day 7:** Team check-in, iterate

**Key principle:** 10-15 min onboarding unlocks full access (not hours of setup).

---

## 🌳 DECISION TREE: LAUNCH APPROACH

```
START: Build phase complete, ready to launch
  ↓
BETA MEMBERS VALIDATED?
├─ YES: 5-10 paying members happy
│  ├─ Full launch to wider audience
│  └─ Use gated onboarding approach
│
└─ NO: Haven't validated yet
   ├─ Stay in beta longer
   ├─ More serve calls
   └─ Don't open gates until validated

GATING STRATEGY:
├─ Onboarding course (10-15 min) → Unlock full access
├─ OR Approval required → Manual review before access
└─ OR Open access → Trust + monitor (not recommended)

RECOMMENDED: Gated onboarding (balance momentum + tracking)
```

---

- [ ] Support channel ready (Slack/email)
- [ ] First-week calendar blocked

**Analytics:**
- [ ] Tracking setup (completion rates)
- [ ] Hidden tags configured
- [ ] Dashboard for monitoring
- [ ] Red flag alerts defined

---

## 🚪 PHASE 1: GATED ONBOARDING (Day 1)

### Pattern: Unlock After 10-15 Min Course

**Traditional approach (DON'T DO THIS):**
- Member pays → Sees everything immediately
- Overwhelmed, doesn't know where to start
- Skips important setup
- Never fully engaged

**Gated onboarding (DO THIS):**
- Member pays → Sees ONLY onboarding course
- 10-15 minute completion → Unlocks full community
- Forces critical steps
- Ensures proper orientation

---

### Onboarding Course Structure (5-7 Lessons)

**Lesson 1: Welcome** (2 min)
```
VIDEO: 
"Welcome to [Community Name]! I'm [Name], and I'm excited you're here.

Here's what to expect:
- This community is [promise statement]
- We meet [frequency] for [format]
- Your first step is completing this quick onboarding

Let's get started."

BUTTON: "Next →"
```

---

**Lesson 2: Who This Is For** (1 min)
```
TEXT POST:
"This community is specifically for [target avatar].

If you're [current state] and want to [desired state], you're in the right place.

We focus on [specific outcomes], NOT [what you're not].

Sound like you? Great. Let's continue."

BUTTON: "That's me →"
```

---

**Lesson 3: Complete Your Profile** (2 min)
```
TEXT POST:
"Quick task: Complete your Circle profile.

REQUIRED FIELDS:
- Full name
- Profile photo
- Location
- What you do

WHY: So other members can find and connect with you.

Click 'Edit Profile' above, fill it out, then come back and click Next."

BUTTON: "Profile complete →"
```

---

**Lesson 4: Introduce Yourself** (2 min)
```
TEXT POST:
"Post your intro in the community space.

TEMPLATE:
- Name + Location
- What you do
- What you're working on
- What you hope to get from this community

Click the button below to post your intro."

BUTTON: "Post intro →" (links to community space)
```

---

**Lesson 5: Schedule Your Onboarding Call** (3 min)
```
TEXT POST:
"Important: Schedule your 1-on-1 onboarding call with [Name].

This is a 30-minute call where we'll:
- Get to know you
- Answer your questions
- Set you up for success

Click below to book your call."

BUTTON: "Schedule call →" (links to Calendly)

NOTE: This triggers hidden tag when completed (via automation)
```

---

**Lesson 6: First Event** (2 min)
```
TEXT POST:
"Our first live session is [Date/Time].

WHAT WE'LL COVER:
- [Topic 1]
- [Topic 2]
- [Open Q&A]

Mark your calendar - see you there!"

BUTTON: "Add to calendar →"
```

---

**Lesson 7: You're In!** (1 min)
```
TEXT POST:
"Congrats! You're all set up.

Click below to access the full community.

Welcome aboard!"

BUTTON: "Enter community →" (unlocks full access)
```

---

### Automation: Track Completion

**Hidden tags to apply:**
- `onboarding_complete` - Finished course
- `onboarding_scheduled` - Booked call (via Calendly trigger)
- `intro_posted` - Posted introduction
- `profile_complete` - Filled out profile

**Why hidden tags:**
- Track without showing members
- Filter for follow-up
- Identify stragglers
- Measure completion rates

---

## 📞 PHASE 2: CALENDLY → CIRCLE AUTOMATION

### Problem: Members Skip Scheduling

**Challenge:**
Members click "next, next, next" through onboarding without actually booking their call.

**Solution:**
```
Member clicks Calendly link → Enters email → Books call
  ↓
Trigger: Calendly event booked
  ↓
Make.com automation:
  1. Grab email from Calendly
  2. Find member in Circle by email
  3. Add hidden tag: "onboarding_scheduled"
  ↓
Result: Can filter members who haven't scheduled
```

---

### Follow-Up Automation

**Day 3 after joining:**
```
IF no "onboarding_scheduled" tag:
  ↓
Send DM:
"Hey [Name]! Noticed you haven't scheduled your onboarding call yet. 
Here's the link: [Calendly URL]

Looking forward to connecting!"
```

**Day 7 after joining:**
```
IF still no "onboarding_scheduled" tag:
  ↓
Personal outreach from community manager:
"Hi [Name], wanted to check in - everything going okay? Would love to get 
you on the calendar for your onboarding call. When works for you this week?"
```

---

## 👥 PHASE 3: SQUAD/GROUP PLACEMENT (If Applicable)

### Pattern: Profile-Based Auto-Assignment

**Challenge (Manual placement):**
- Community manager bottleneck
- New members can't access until placed
- Doesn't scale

**Solution (Automated placement):**
```
Member completes profile → Answers placement questions
  ↓
Make.com automation checks answers:
  - Role
  - Firm size
  - Focus area
  - Experience level
  ↓
Auto-assigns to correct squad/group
  ↓
Updates space permissions automatically
```

**Real example (Realize):**
> "We have an automation in Make that will check profile updates, determine 
> squad assignment, remove old space access, give new space access. No manual 
> placement needed anymore."

**Scales infinitely.**

---

### Placement Questions (Profile Custom Fields)

**Example fields:**
- Role: [Founder / Manager / Individual Contributor]
- Company size: [1-10 / 11-50 / 51-200 / 200+]
- Focus area: [Product / Engineering / Marketing / Sales]
- Experience: [0-2 years / 3-5 years / 6-10 years / 10+ years]

**Automation logic:**
```
IF Role = Founder AND Company size = 1-10:
  → Assign to "Early Stage Founders" squad

IF Role = Manager AND Focus area = Engineering:
  → Assign to "Engineering Leaders" squad

[etc.]
```

---

## 📅 PHASE 4: FIRST WEEK EXPERIENCE

### Day 1-2: Welcome & Orientation

**What happens:**
- Members complete onboarding course
- Post introductions
- Schedule onboarding calls
- Explore community

**Team actions:**
- Monitor onboarding completion
- Welcome new intros
- Answer questions in support channel
- Fix any immediate issues

---

### Day 3-4: First Onboarding Calls

**30-minute call structure:**
```
MINUTE 0-10: Get to know them
- "Tell me about your situation"
- "What brought you here?"
- "What are you hoping to get out of this?"

MINUTE 10-20: Orient to community
- Show them around Circle
- Explain event calendar
- Answer questions
- Set expectations

MINUTE 20-30: Set them up for success
- "What's your first goal here?"
- "What would make this worth it for you?"
- "See you at [next event]!"
```

**Track:**
- [ ] Attendance (who's completing calls)
- [ ] Common questions (update onboarding)
- [ ] Red flags (disengaged, wrong fit)

---

### Day 5-7: First Live Sessions

**First session is CRITICAL:**
- Sets tone for community
- Demonstrates value immediately
- Creates early wins
- Builds momentum

**Format (15 min teach + 75 min do):**
```
MINUTE 0-15: Teaching
- Introduce framework/concept
- Show examples
- Answer clarifying questions

MINUTE 15-90: Doing
- Members work on their actual problem
- You circulate and help
- Screen share, live coaching
- Tangible progress by end
```

**Why this works:**
- Immediate value (not "homework for next week")
- Accountability (they actually do it)
- Community (see each other work)
- Momentum (progress every session)

---

## 🔄 PHASE 5: POST-LAUNCH ITERATION (Week 2-4)

### Week 2: Monitor & Fix

**What to track:**
- [ ] Onboarding completion rate (target: 80%+)
- [ ] Call scheduling rate (target: 70%+)
- [ ] First event attendance (track baseline)
- [ ] Support ticket volume

**What to fix:**
- Friction points in onboarding
- Broken automation
- Unclear instructions
- Missing content

---

### Week 3-4: Iterate & Scale

**Based on data:**
- What's working? → Double down
- What's not working? → Fix or kill
- What's missing? → Add quickly
- What's friction? → Smooth out

**Real example (Realize Week 2):**
- Converted welcome flow → course (better tracking)
- Added Calendly → Circle automation
- Simplified squad placement (fully automated)

---

## ⚠️ COMMON LAUNCH MISTAKES

**Mistake 1: Overwhelming new members**
- Show everything at once, no clear path
- Solution: Gated onboarding course

**Mistake 2: Can't track completion**
- No analytics on who did what
- Solution: Hidden tags + course tracking

**Mistake 3: Too much friction**
- Make them wait for approval/placement
- Solution: 10-15 min unlock, automated placement

**Mistake 4: Manual bottlenecks**
- Community manager has to place everyone
- Solution: Profile-based automation

**Mistake 5: No follow-up for stragglers**
- People who don't complete onboarding get forgotten
- Solution: Day 3 + Day 7 nudges

---

## 🔑 KEY FRAMEWORKS

### 1. Balance Momentum vs Friction

**Concept:** Let them in fast, but capture critical data

**Jordan's principle:**
> "Don't make them wait till Monday if they're fired up Saturday night."

**The balance:**
- **Too much friction:** Lose momentum, drop off
- **Too little friction:** Skip steps, miss setup
- **Just right:** 10-15 min unlocks access

---

### 2. Gated Onboarding

**Pattern:**
```
Join → See ONLY onboarding → Complete course → Unlock full access
```

**Why it works:**
- Forces critical steps
- Tracks completion
- Ensures orientation
- Still fast (10-15 min)

---

### 3. Calendly → Circle Integration

**Pattern:**
```
Calendly booking → Make.com trigger → Hidden tag in Circle
```

**Enables:**
- Track who scheduled
- Filter stragglers
- Automate follow-up
- No manual tracking

---

## ✅ WEEKLY SYNC TEMPLATE

### Attendees
- Client (community owner)
- Jordan/Filip/Shannon (GrowthCommunity team)
- Community manager (if hired)

### Duration
30-45 minutes (not 60+)

### Format
Video call, recorded via Fathom for notes

---

### Agenda

**SECTION 1: Action Items Review (5 min)**

```
"What did we commit to last week? Let's check status."

FOR EACH ACTION ITEM:
□ Done? ✅
□ In progress? 🟡 (new timeline)
□ Blocked? 🔴 (what's blocking)
□ Dropped? ❌ (why)
```

**Don't skip this.** Accountability matters.

---

**SECTION 2: Metrics Check (5 min)**

```
GROWTH:
- New members this week: [#]
- Total active members: [#]
- Growth rate: [%]

ENGAGEMENT:
- Event attendance: [#] (up/down from last week)
- Posts created: [#] (member posts, not admin)
- Active %: [%] (engaged this week)

CHURN:
- Cancellations this week: [#]
- Churn rate: [%]
- Top churn reason: [from exit surveys]

REVENUE:
- MRR: $[amount]
- New MRR: $[from new members]
- Churned MRR: $[from cancellations]

```

**Look for trends, not single-week blips.**

---

**SECTION 3: Issues & Blockers (15 min)**

```
"What's broken? What's slowing us down? What needs attention?"

[Go around the table, everyone shares]

JORDAN/FILIP/SHANNON: [Issues from our side]
CLIENT: [Issues from their side]
COMMUNITY MANAGER: [Issues from operations]

FOR EACH ISSUE:
- What's the impact? (Critical / Important / Nice to have)
- Root cause? (Don't just treat symptoms)
- Who can solve? (Assign owner)
- Timeline? (This week / Next week / Backlog)
```

**Prioritize ruthlessly.** Can't fix everything at once.

---

**SECTION 4: Prioritization (10 min)**

```
"Of everything we just discussed, what are the TOP 3 priorities for this week?"

PRIORITY 1: [Most critical thing]
- Owner: [Name]
- Done by: [Date]
- Success looks like: [Specific outcome]

PRIORITY 2: [Second most critical]
- Owner: [Name]
- Done by: [Date]
- Success looks like: [Specific outcome]

PRIORITY 3: [Third most critical]
- Owner: [Name]
- Done by: [Date]
- Success looks like: [Specific outcome]

EVERYTHING ELSE: Backlog (revisit next week if still important)
```

**Limit to 3.** More than 3 = nothing gets done.

---

**SECTION 5: Wins & Next Steps (5 min)**

```
"What went well this week? What are we celebrating?"

[Quick round of wins, keep it positive]

NEXT MEETING: [Same day/time next week]

HOMEWORK:
- You: [Specific deliverable if any]
- Us: [What we're preparing]
```

**End on a positive note.**

---

---

## 🚪 CHURN MANAGEMENT

### Exit Survey Setup

**Two cancellation paths:**

**Path 1: Managed (WITH survey):**
```
Member clicks "Manage Account" link
  ↓
Tally form: "What would you like to do?"
  ├─ Update payment → Redirect to Circle billing
  └─ Cancel subscription → Exit survey
```

**Path 2: Direct (BYPASS survey):**
```
Member goes to profile → Billing → Cancel
  ↓
Skips exit survey
```

**Strategy:**
- Enable self-cancellation (don't force permission)
- Make managed path prominent in FAQs
- Accept not everyone will fill survey (maybe 50-70%)
- Capture what you can

**Jake's wisdom:**
> "We're okay with some percentage not filling it out. We make the FAQs 
> prominent with the link, and we get what we can. Can't force 100%."

---

### Exit Survey Questions

**Question 1: Why are you leaving?** (Multiple choice)
- [ ] Too expensive
- [ ] Not enough value
- [ ] Not enough time
- [ ] Found another solution
- [ ] Other: [text field]

**Question 2: What would have made you stay?** (Free text)

**Question 3: How likely to recommend?** (NPS 0-10 scale)

**Question 4: Can we follow up?** (Email for potential win-back)

---

### Analyzing Churn

**Monthly churn review:**
```
1. Pull exit survey responses
2. Group by reason (category breakdown)
3. Identify patterns:
   - One reason dominating? (fix that)
   - Multiple scattered reasons? (broader issue)
   - No clear pattern? (natural churn, acceptable)

4. Prioritize fixes:
   - HIGH: Affects >30% of churners
   - MEDIUM: Affects 10-30%
   - LOW: One-off issues
```

**Don't try to save everyone.** Some churn is natural.

---

## 🔧 AUTOMATION MAINTENANCE

### Pattern: Monitor → Report → Fix → Verify

**Common automation issues:**

**Issue 1: Members not removed after cancellation**
- **Symptom:** Canceled members still have access
- **Cause:** Circle payment sync issues, migration edge cases
- **Fix:** Manual daily audit until Circle resolves
- **Prevention:** Weekly automation health check

**Issue 2: Onboarding tags not applying**
- **Symptom:** Can't filter who scheduled calls
- **Cause:** Calendly → Circle integration broken
- **Fix:** Rebuild Make.com scenario
- **Prevention:** Test automation monthly

**Issue 3: Squad assignments wrong**
- **Symptom:** Members in wrong groups
- **Cause:** Profile questions changed, logic outdated
- **Fix:** Update Make.com logic, re-run assignments
- **Prevention:** Document profile → assignment mapping

---

### Filip's Approach (Realize Jan 28)

**Problem:** Members not getting kicked after cancellation

**Response:**
> "I've checked the workflows... I cannot identify any pattern. So I've 
> reached out to Circle support. Until then, I can just hop in daily and 
> manually kick them out."

**Key principle:** Manual workaround while investigating > letting members stay after canceling.

---

## 👥 TEAM SCALING

### Pattern: Bottleneck → Document → Hire → Train

**When to hire:**

**Hiring trigger checklist:**
- [ ] Bottleneck identified (one person overwhelmed)
- [ ] Bottleneck documented (what tasks, how much time)
- [ ] Can't automate (already tried)
- [ ] Revenue supports salary
- [ ] Role clearly defined

**Don't hire until all 5 are YES.**

---

### Real Example: Realize Team Scaling

**Hire 1: Pod Coordinator (Stephanie)**
- **Trigger:** Jake spending 10+ hours/week on pod placements
- **Solution:** Contract experienced facilitator as coordinator
- **Result:** Jake's time freed, smoother placements

**Hire 2: Dedicated Facilitators (Next hire)**
- **Trigger:** Busy firm owners can't commit to 90-min sessions
- **Solution:** Hire people whose job IS facilitation
- **Result:** Consistent quality, scalable model

**Jake's realization:**
> "The next hire is probably somebody whose dedicated job is just to be a 
> facilitator of 90-minute sessions, not firm owners who are busy."

## 📈 ENGAGEMENT OPTIMIZATION

### Pattern: Measure → Experiment → Double Down

**What to optimize:**

**1. Event Attendance**
- **Track:** Attendance rate per event type
- **Experiment:** Different days/times, formats, topics
- **Double down:** Scale what works, kill what doesn't

**2. Post Engagement**
- **Track:** Comments per post, reaction rate
- **Experiment:** Question formats, prompts, challenges
- **Double down:** Templates for high-engagement posts

**3. First-Week Experience**
- **Track:** % completing onboarding, first event attended
- **Experiment:** Onboarding length, nudge timing
- **Double down:** Smooth path that converts to active

**4. Pod/Mastermind Retention**
- **Track:** Attendance rate, completion rate
- **Experiment:** Facilitator training, agenda formats
- **Double down:** Best facilitators, proven agendas

---

### Experimentation Framework

**One big experiment per week:**
```
WEEK: [Date]
EXPERIMENT: [What we're testing]
HYPOTHESIS: [What we think will happen]
SUCCESS METRIC: [How we measure]
RESULT: [What actually happened]
DECISION: [Scale / Kill / Iterate]
```

**Don't optimize 5 things at once.** Can't tell what worked.

## 💬 MEMBER FEEDBACK LOOPS

### Pattern: Ask → Listen → Act → Tell

**How to collect feedback:**

**1. Exit Surveys** (required for managed cancellation)
- Analyze quarterly
- Group by themes

**2. Periodic Check-Ins**
- NPS survey (quarterly)
- "How are we doing?" DM (monthly to random sample)
- Post-event feedback (after major events)

**3. Community Listening**
- What questions come up repeatedly?
- What features do people request?
- What complaints surface?

**4. Team Observations**
- What breaks? What's smooth?
- What takes too much time?
- What delights members?

---

### Close the Loop

**DON'T:** Ask for feedback you won't act on

**DO:** Tell them what you did with their feedback

**Script:**
```
"Last month, 15 of you said [specific feedback]. We heard you.

Here's what we built: [Solution]

Thanks for making this community better!"
```

**Members need to see feedback = action.**

## 🔄 CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT CYCLE

**4-Week Iteration Cycle:**

**Week 1:** Identify friction point  
**Week 2:** Experiment with fix  
**Week 3:** Measure result  
**Week 4:** Scale or kill

**Example (Realize Jan 2026):**
- **Friction:** Exit survey bypass
- **Experiment:** Prominent FAQ link to managed flow
- **Measure:** Survey completion rate
- **Result:** TBD (just implemented)

**Example (Austin Dec 2025):**
- **Friction:** Pre-launch, building too much
- **Experiment:** Pre-sell first, build after
- **Measure:** 5-10 sign-ups before building
- **Result:** ✅ Validated demand, built with feedback

## ⚠️ COMMON OPTIMIZE MISTAKES

**Mistake 1: Not tracking churn reasons**
- Flying blind on why people leave
- Solution: Exit survey, analyze quarterly

**Mistake 2: Building before validating**
- Spend weeks on features nobody wants
- Solution: Ask → Test → Build

**Mistake 3: Ignoring support volume**
- Same questions over and over
- Solution: FAQ, automation, documentation

**Mistake 4: Not firing bad facilitators**
- One bad experience kills retention
- Solution: Evaluate, train, replace if needed

**Mistake 5: Optimizing too many things at once**
- Can't tell what worked
- Solution: One big thing per week

## 🔑 KEY FRAMEWORKS

### 1. Short Weekly Syncs

**Concept:** 30-45 min, focused on action (not status updates)

**Why it works:**
- Keeps team aligned
- Surfaces issues fast
- Forces prioritization
- Creates momentum

**Anti-pattern:** 90-min meandering status meetings

---

### 2. Manual Workarounds While Investigating

**Concept:** Don't wait for perfect fix, manually handle while debugging

**Filip's approach:**
> "I cannot identify the pattern, so I've reached out to Circle. Until then, 
> I'll manually check daily and kick out canceled members."

**Why it works:**
- Problem gets handled NOW
- Doesn't block progress
- Root cause investigation happens in parallel

---

### 3. One Big Thing Per Week

**Concept:** Limit improvements to 1 major thing per week

**Why it works:**
- Can measure what moved the needle
- Team stays focused
- Compound improvements over time

**Anti-pattern:** 10 initiatives, nothing ships

---

## 📊 OPTIMIZE SUCCESS METRICS

**Month 1-3 (Stabilize):**
- Churn <8%
- Support load manageable
- Automations working
- Team not overwhelmed

**Month 4-6 (Improve):**
- Churn <6%
- Event attendance growing
- NPS >40
- First hires made

**Month 7-12 (Scale):**
- Churn <5%
- Multiple cohorts running
- Team operating smoothly
- Revenue growing
