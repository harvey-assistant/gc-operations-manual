## 🏛️ CIRCLE ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS

### Pattern 1: Operational Audit (Realize May 19, 2025)

**Context:** Jake/Realize had community running, needed operational clarity

**Jordan's audit questions:**
- "What would be a huge win for you with this audit?"
- "Talk to me about where the operational staffing blocks are"
- "Is there a clear transformation or just education + connection?"

**Key issues uncovered:**
- **Staffing bottleneck:** "Jake's at his limit right now"
- **Role clarity needed:** "Getting really explicit about what all the expectations are, who needs to be doing what every day, week and month"
- **Operational tasks:**
  - Member onboarding
  - Pod assignments & management
  - Event calendar management
  - Thread engagement
  - Financial/payment operations
  - Sales conversion calls

**Jordan's insight:**
> "Most communities struggle with retention because they're designed to create a transformation after which there's no point in sticking around. So you've intentionally steered clear of that - framing more as access to a network."

**Pattern:** Build phase isn't just Circle setup - it's clarifying WHO does WHAT and HOW the operations actually run.

---

### Pattern 2: Network vs. Transformation Model

**Two community models:**

**Transformation Model:**
- Designed to create specific outcome
- Members "graduate" after achieving it
- High churn by design
- Content/education focused
- Examples: "Lose 20 pounds," "Launch your business"

**Network Model (Realize approach):**
- Access to peers + experts
- No "graduation" - ongoing value
- Lower churn potential
- Connection/resources focused
- Examples: "Firm alliances," professional networks

**Jordan's observation:**
> "I see a trend being like yin and yang. You either have a really specific transformation with a beginning and end, OR you have ongoing network value without the hamster wheel of new content every month."

**Design decision:** Which model fits your offer?

---

## 📅 EVENT PROGRAMMING

### Pattern: Event Calendar as Engagement Driver

**Jake/Realize insight:**
> "I think a big part of keeping people around is having an event calendar built out."

**Event types mentioned:**
- **Pods** - 6-month cohorts, smaller groups
- **Masterminds** - Expert-led sessions
- **Regular events** - Ongoing programming
- **Topic-based events** - As relevant issues emerge

**Operational challenge:**
- Managing event facilitators
- Scheduling/coordination
- Keeping calendar fresh
- Payment/compensation for facilitators

**Build phase task:** Create 3-6 month event calendar BEFORE launch.

---

## 👥 TEAM ROLES & STAFFING

### Pattern: Split Operations from Content

**Realize structure:**
- **Jason (CEO):** Content, live events, lead generation
- **Jake (Community Lead):** Sales, onboarding, member experience, operations

**Jason's boundary:**
> "The community is almost a business entirely independent of me and has to kind of stay that way."

**Sales gap identified:**
> "We could use someone with more of a sales background. We've got the media machine to bring folks to the doorstep, but with a little bit more sales chops, I think we could convert a lot more people."

**Operational roles needed:**
1. **Community Manager** - Onboarding, member engagement
2. **Operations Coordinator** - Event calendar, pod assignments
3. **Sales/Conversion** - Lead nurture, conversion calls
4. **Content Moderator** - Thread engagement, connections
5. **Finance/Admin** - Payments, facilitator compensation

**Pattern:** Don't assume founder runs everything - build with delegation in mind.

- [ ] Team clarity score (1-10: do they know their roles?)
- [ ] Content completion (% of planned assets created)
- [ ] Event calendar fill (months scheduled)
- [ ] Soft launch feedback (qualitative)

**Red flags:**
- Unclear roles ("Who does onboarding?")
- Empty calendar (no events scheduled)
- Founder bottleneck (everything runs through one person)
- No testing (launching blind)

---

## 🎬 REAL BUILD SESSION EXAMPLES

### Realize - Operational Audit (May 19, 2025)

**Session format:** 60-minute audit with Jake K + Jason

**Jordan's approach:**
1. Start with wins: "What would make this audit awesome?"
2. Understand current state: "Where are the operational blocks?"
3. Identify gaps: "Is there a clear transformation?"
4. Surface pain: "Talk to me about staffing challenges"
5. Prioritize: "What's most locked on right now?"

**Key decisions made:**
- Focus: Staffing/operational clarity (not growth yet)
- Model: Network (not transformation)
- Next: Document roles, hire operational support

---

## 💡 BUILD PHASE WISDOM

### Things Jordan Looks For:

**Operational clarity:**
- Who does what, when?
- What happens daily/weekly/monthly?
- Where are bottlenecks?

**Scalability:**
- Can this run without founder?
- What breaks at 100 members? 500?
- Where will you need to hire?

**Member experience:**
- What does first week look like?
- How do they get value fast?
- What keeps them coming back?

**Retention model:**
- Transformation-based (high churn)?
- Network-based (low churn)?
- Hybrid?

## 🚧 COMMON BUILD PHASE MISTAKES

**Mistake 1: Building too much before testing**
- Creating months of content nobody wants
- Building features you'll never use
- Solution: Start minimal, iterate based on feedback

**Mistake 2: Unclear team roles**
- "We'll figure it out as we go"
- Founder doing everything
- Solution: Document WHO does WHAT on Day 1

**Mistake 3: No event calendar**
- "We'll schedule events as needed"
- Empty calendar = disengagement
- Solution: Pre-schedule 3-6 months minimum

**Mistake 4: Skipping soft launch**
- Launching to full audience without testing
- No feedback before going live
- Solution: Friends/family soft launch first

## 🚀 PRE-SELL BEFORE BUILD (Austin Dec 18, 2025)

### Pattern: Reach Out → Sell → Build

**Traditional approach (SLOW):**
1. Build entire program
2. Create landing page
3. Film sales video
4. Launch publicly
5. Hope people buy

**Jordan's approach (FAST):**
1. Reach out to 5-10 handpicked people
2. Sell them on outcome (not features)
3. Get their money + objections
4. Build based on real feedback
5. Launch publicly with validated offer

**Austin's realization:**
> "Dude, I was like, I have nothing to sell. Like I can't tell people about it, but then I have nowhere to send them and there's no paywall. There's nothing built yet."

**Jordan's response:**
> "Why don't we just follow the same approach where we're reaching out to people you already have trust with? Identify the 10 people, do very similar outreach like you did with text message, and if they want to jump on a call, you handle their objections one at a time."

**Key principle:** You sell 100x better than a sales page. Don't hide behind assets - have conversations first.

---

## 📞 SERVE CALLS > LANDING PAGES

### Pattern: Conversation-Based Selling

**Jordan's philosophy:**
> "When we put something into a landing page or video, we're setting it in stone. I think it would be better if you had these conversations, you got their real objections, their real questions, their real concerns, their real confusions. And then we use that to put into the landing page for the next go round."

**Serve call approach:**
1. Lead with the hook (outcome)
2. Wait for them to ask questions
3. Handle objections one at a time
4. Ask: "Now are you ready to join?"
5. Repeat until yes or clear no

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't give them a million pieces of information
- Don't list all the lessons/features
- Don't create "surface area for objections"

**What TO do:**
- Sell the outcome (not the how)
- Handle objections individually
- Move them toward decision

**Jordan's example:**
> "This is going to help you get to 40K a month, automated, consistent, recurring payments, and get you out of the day-to-day operations. They're going to go, wow, that sounds freaking amazing. They're either going to say, how much is it? Or they're going to ask questions. And you handle them one at a time."

---

## 🏃‍♂️ WORK HAPPENS ON CALLS (Not Homework)

### Pattern: Execution-Based Programming

**Jordan's core philosophy:**
> "Your customers are not looking to buy more information. They're looking to buy a shortcut to the outcome. And that shortcut might look like, hey, every week for these 90 minutes, I'm going to teach you for like 15, and then for 75, we're just going to do the actual freaking work right here, right now."

**Traditional model (BAD):**
- 90-minute lecture
- Send them away with homework
- Hope they do it
- Most don't
- They fall behind
- They churn

**Execution model (GOOD):**
- 15-minute teaching
- 75 minutes doing the work TOGETHER
- They get stuck, you help immediately
- They leave with it DONE
- No homework guilt
- They stay engaged

**Why this works:**
> "If we can say the majority of the work of this program is going to happen right here on these calls, then it's like, okay, sweet, I'm not going to skip and try to watch the replay later because then I know I'm not really going to probably do it."

**Onboarding pitch:**
"It's super important to be here live because we're actually going to do the work. When you get stuck in the middle of the work and have a question, you immediately raise your hand and I immediately help you solve that question. If you try to do this on your own later watching the replay, you're not getting any help, you're probably just going to stay stuck and confused and fall behind."

## 💰 SIMPLE PAYMENT SETUP

### Pattern: Circle Paywall Link (Skip Heavy Sales Assets)

**What you need:**
- Circle paywall configured
- 1-2 payment options (one-time + installments)
- Welcome space for buyers
- That's it

**Austin's setup:**
- **One-time:** $1,995
- **Installments:** 2 x $1,100 (1 month apart)
- **Paywall link:** Direct to Circle checkout
- **Post-purchase:** Land in "Welcome" space with video

**Filip's build:**
- Created paywall with both options
- Built simple checkout page (bullets, not heavy copy)
- Welcome space with 1-minute video
- Pre-selling space (while building rest)

**Key insight:**
> "The landing page has to do 100% of all of the explaining and selling and convincing and urgency and scarcity. It's definitely not going to do as good of a job as you're going to do." - Jordan

---

## 🏷️ DON'T OVERTHINK NAMES

### Pattern: Name Can Come Later

**Jordan's advice:**
> "At this stage, especially since this is like a secret launch or beta launch, you're not about to run a ton of ads and millions of people are going to see this. I feel like we just do something super basic. You could even avoid using a name. You could say, Hey, I'm starting this new program, it's going to help you get 40K months recurring, I'm only letting these five people in, are you interested?"

**Why naming can wait:**
- Beta launch = small audience
- They care about outcome, not brand
- Hard to pick under time pressure
- Better names come from customer language
- You don't want to stick with something you don't love

**Jordan's approach:**
"Sometimes naming is really hard. If we say we have to pick a name in the next 30 minutes versus you're out on a run and you get this idea... where I think some of the great ideas would come from would be from talking to your customers and from those dreams, drains, and doubts. If it had the aspirational dream baked into the name, that's really great."

**Austin's insight from customer research:**
"The word that kept coming up was freedom."

**Pattern:** Let the name emerge from real customer language, not brainstorming sessions.

---

## 📧 BETA OUTREACH TEMPLATE (Austin's Email)

**Subject:** Hand-selected for [Program Name]

**Body structure:**
1. **Hook:** "If you're getting this email, I've hand selected you"
2. **Context:** "You know we have selected all the people for our Empire program"
3. **Outcome:** "This program is specifically designed for chiropractors running their first location who want to get to 40K automated recurring billing months"
4. **Invitation:** "This is a hand select for you as part of this initial program"
5. **CTA:** "Are you interested?" or "Want to learn more?"

**What makes it work:**
- Exclusivity (hand-selected)
- Clear outcome (40K recurring)
- Low ask (just interest, not full commitment yet)
- Opens door for conversation

---

## 🎯 BUILD PHASE DECISION FRAMEWORK

**When to build BEFORE selling:**
- Public launch (need assets ready)
- No existing audience/trust
- High-volume funnel
- Self-service model

**When to sell BEFORE building:**
- Beta/soft launch
- Existing audience with trust
- Small cohort (5-20 people)
- Feedback-driven model

**Austin's situation:** Existing audience at Growth Summit event = perfect for sell-first approach.

## 💡 BUILD PHASE WISDOM (Compiled)

**From Jordan:**
- "You sell 100x better than a sales page"
- "Sell them what they want (outcome), give them what they need (execution)"
- "Work happens on calls, not homework"
- "Getting their real objections first > perfect landing page"
- "Name can come from customer language later"

**From Austin:**
- "Jake's email said 'nothing for you to do' = huge relief"
- "Freedom kept coming up in customer research"
- "I have nothing built yet but we're selling anyway"

**From Filip:**
- Landing page is ready but we're bypassing it for beta
- Simple paywall link > heavy sales funnel for beta
- Welcome space with video is enough to start

---

## 🚨 BUILD PHASE RED FLAGS

**Warning signs you're overthinking:**
- Spending weeks on landing page copy
- Trying to have "perfect" name before selling
- Building all content before first customer
- Creating complex sales funnels for 10 people
- Delaying launch because "it's not ready"

**Better approach:**
- Reach out today
- Have conversations this week
- Take money next week
- Build together with customers
- Launch imperfectly, iterate quickly
