## Gaps Analysis

**What we're missing to move forward:**

1. **Google Drive access** - Need to set up read-only access to existing process docs (NOT CRITICAL - can proceed with transcript mining first)
2. ✅ ~~Client goldmines~~ - COMPLETE: Realize (36), Austin (11), Luca (18), Anne-Laure (4)
3. ✅ ~~Transcript access~~ - COMPLETE: 69 transcripts ready for mining

## Questions for Jordan

1. Where are existing process docs? (Google Drive? Notion? Slack?)
2. Which 2-3 clients best represent your process? (Recent, successful, typical)
3. Team validation window: When can Filip/Shannon review? (Days 12-14)
4. Format preference: Markdown vs. Notion vs. Google Docs?
