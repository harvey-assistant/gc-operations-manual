# GrowthCommunity Client Journey - System Map v1

**Extracted from:** Realize (36 transcripts), Austin (11 transcripts), Luca (18 transcripts)  
**Created:** 2026-02-07  
**Updated:** 2026-02-07 (added two customer types)  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS - mining Austin/Luca to complete Build from Scratch journey

---

## TWO DISTINCT CUSTOMER TYPES

### TYPE 1: OPTIMIZE & GROW (e.g., Realize)
**Profile:** Already running a successful program ($50K+ revenue), needs to scale/systematize  
**Start Point:** Strategy audit of existing community  
**Journey:** Discover → Audit → Optimize → Grow

### TYPE 2: BUILD FROM SCRATCH (e.g., Austin, Luca)
**Profile:** Starting new program from zero, needs design and launch support  
**Start Point:** Design new offering  
**Journey:** Discover → Design → Build → Launch → Optimize → Grow

---

## CUSTOMER TYPE 1: OPTIMIZE & GROW (REALIZE MODEL)

```
INBOUND LEAD
    ↓
DISCOVERY CALL (30 min)
    ↓
FOLLOW-UP / PROPOSAL (45 min)
    ↓
KICKOFF / ONBOARDING (60 min)
    ↓
STRATEGY AUDIT DELIVERY (async + 60 min)
    ↓
DESIGN / BUILD (6-8 weeks, weekly check-ins)
    ↓
OPTIMIZE (ongoing, weekly → biweekly syncs)
    ↓
GROW (ongoing, monthly strategy + team execution)
```

**Key Difference:** Starts with audit, no launch phase needed (already live)

---

## CUSTOMER TYPE 2: BUILD FROM SCRATCH (AUSTIN/LUCA MODEL)

```
INBOUND LEAD
    ↓
DISCOVERY CALL (30 min)
    ↓
FOLLOW-UP / PROPOSAL (45 min)
    ↓
KICKOFF / ONBOARDING (60 min)
    ↓
DESIGN (4-6 weeks, define offering)
    ↓
BUILD (4-6 weeks, create in Circle)
    ↓
LAUNCH (1-2 weeks intensive support)
    ↓
OPTIMIZE (ongoing, weekly → biweekly syncs)
    ↓
GROW (ongoing, monthly strategy + team execution)
```

**Key Difference:** Starts with design, includes launch phase, no audit needed

---

## PHASE 1: SALES / DISCOVERY

**Duration:** 30 minutes  
**Participants:** Jordan + Lead (Jake Kessenich at Realize)  
**Goal:** Qualify fit, understand current state, identify pain points

### Structure
1. **Rapport** (1-2 min) - Small talk, connection
2. **Discovery** (15 min) - Let them explain everything
3. **Positioning** (10 min) - Describe offering, show social proof
4. **Qualification** (2 min) - Budget, timeline, fit check
5. **Close** (1 min) - Book follow-up

### Jordan's Discovery Questions (Exact Order)
1. "What was the main motivation behind reaching out?"
2. [Dig into current structure/model details]
3. "What would you say your biggest goals are?"
4. "Is this scale fast and sell in 12 months, or get to $200K/month?" (strategic vision)
5. "What would be some of the biggest challenges you'd want to immediately tackle?"
6. "Does it sound like alignment with what you're looking for - budget, timeline?"

### Positioning Method
- **Don't pitch early** - Let them talk for 15 minutes first
- **Validate success** - "You're killing it, top 10-20% already"
- **Show don't tell** - Pull up similar client example (Exit Five for Realize)
- **Identify 3-5 quick wins** - Immediate value they can see
- **Soft close** - "Let's chat more" (no pressure, no proposal yet)

### Outputs
- Qualified lead (budget confirmed, goals clear, pain identified)
- Follow-up meeting booked (within 7 days)
- Rapport established

### Common Pain Points (from Realize)
- Admin burden (onboarding calls, tagging, segmentation)
- Scaling concern ("if we promote it, we'll break it")
- Quality vs. scale tension (maintain intimacy while growing)
- Team efficiency (expensive people doing low-value tasks)
- Foundation gaps (need automation/systems before growth)

---

3. Walk through engagement model
4. Pricing discussion
5. Address objections
6. Get commitment or set decision timeline

### Outputs
- Signed agreement
- Payment processed
- Kickoff scheduled (within 2 weeks)

### Pricing Model (Inferred from Realize)
- Appears to be project-based or retainer

---

## PHASE 4B: DESIGN (TYPE 2: BUILD FROM SCRATCH ONLY)

**Applies to:** Clients starting from zero (Austin Cohen model)  
**Duration:** 30 days (4 weeks)  
**Cadence:** Rapid iteration - every 2-3 days initially, then weekly  
**Participants:** Jordan + Client (+ Shannon for systems discussions)  
**Goal:** Design complete offering with 99% clarity through iterative refinement

### Structure: Iterative Clarity Model
**10% Clear Plan** (Day 1 - Kickoff)
- Jordan presents IDEAS upfront (not blank page)
- Client reacts, refines, rejects
- Faster than starting from scratch
- "I took liberties of guessing so you have something to respond to"

**50% Clear Plan** (Days 3-14)
- Deep dives on offer details
- Customer validation (mine existing clients' verbatim language)
- Refine positioning, pricing, structure
- Meeting every 2-3 days initially

**99% Clear Plan** (Days 15-30)
- Customer research and validation complete
- Final offer locked
- 90-day build plan finalized
- Confidence to execute

### Kickoff Meeting (Day 1, 60 min)

**Agenda:**
1. **Orient to process** (5 min) - Show 3-phase journey map
2. **North Star goals** (10 min) - Key dates, events, revenue targets
3. **Capture existing work** (20 min) - What client already has/knows
4. **Present 10% plan** (20 min) - Jordan's initial ideas for client to react to
5. **Teach methodology** (ongoing) - Problems-first approach, verbatim language
6. **Book follow-up** (5 min) - Schedule next meeting in 2-3 days

**Jordan's Kickoff Philosophy:**
- "We want to do things in the opposite way that feels natural to you"
- Don't build ideas - identify PROBLEMS first, then who has them, then solutions
- Ideas are the LAST piece, not the first
- "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication" - avoid complex funnels

### Design Activities (Days 1-30)

**1. Problem Identification**
- Who has the problem?
- What exactly is the problem? (use their verbatim language)
- How painful is it?
- What's the enemy? (what you're NOT)

**2. Verbatim Language Mining** ⭐ CRITICAL
- Record existing client calls
- Extract EXACT words/phrases clients use for goals
- Never summarize - loses emotional punch
- **"Opera Singer Breaking Glass" principle**: Use exact frequency to create visceral reaction
- Example: "Break the million dollar mark and elevate leadership systems" (verbatim)
- vs. "Grow your business" (summarized - loses power)

**3. Offer Design**
- Target audience (specific, not general)
- Promise (transformation, not features)
- Structure (cohort, membership, hybrid, challenge)
- Pricing strategy
- Name/branding ("Show Up and Shine Method" - make it memorable)
- Delivery mechanism

**4. Positioning Framework**
- Simple one-page offer structure
- "If you want X, we'll help you achieve Y in Z timeframe"
- Address top 3-4 objections directly
- Use branded methods/frameworks
- Reference: Profit First, StoryBrand, etc.

**5. Customer Validation**
- Interview existing clients (record & transcribe)
- Test language/positioning with target audience
- Iterate based on feedback
- Validate pricing

**6. 90-Day Build Plan**
- Week-by-week milestones
- What needs to be built in Circle
- Content/curriculum planning
- Launch timeline
- Marketing/sales strategy

### Key Differences from Type 1 (Optimize & Grow)
- **No audit** - Starting fresh
- **Jordan teaches** - Methodology education built into process
- **Faster iteration** - Meeting every 2-3 days initially (vs. weekly)
- **Bring ideas to react to** - Not starting from blank page
- **Verbatim language mining** - Extract from existing clients/audience
- **Validation required** - Must test before building

### Outputs
- 99% clear offer design
- Verbatim customer language bank
- Detailed 90-day build plan
- Pricing finalized
- Launch timeline set
- Positioning/messaging locked
- Customer validation completed
- Transition to Build phase

### Real Example: Austin Cohen (Nov 2025)
- **Starting point:** Empire program ($4K/month, 6 clients at capacity)
- **Goal:** Scale to $10M ("10 million or bus journey")
- **North Star:** Growth Summit Feb 5 (75 chiropractors, $695, launching new offer)
- **Kickoff:** Nov 5 - Presented 10% plan, captured existing client language
- **Follow-up:** Nov 7 (2 days later) - Refining to 50% plan
- **Output:** Simple offer structure (vs. complex funnel), branded methods
