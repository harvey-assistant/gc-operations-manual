# Master Operations Manual - MASTER PLAN

**Project Start:** 2026-02-07  
**Deadline:** 2026-02-21 (2 weeks)  
**Priority:** #1 - Enables Jordan's paternity leave  
**Goal:** Team can run business autonomously with 95%+ accuracy

---

## Success Criteria (Must achieve ALL 5)

1. ✅ Filip/Shannon can onboard next client without asking Jordan a question
2. ✅ Any team member can find answer to "how do we do X?" in < 3 minutes
3. ✅ 95%+ accuracy vs. real client work (validated against transcripts)
4. ✅ Team actually references it in first week (adoption proof)
5. ✅ Jordan trusts it enough to leave for 4 weeks

---

## PHASE 1: Map Reality (Days 1-3)

**Step 1: Audit What Exists**
- List every doc we have about process/operations
- Rate each: High/mid/low altitude, Accurate/outdated, Usable/theoretical
- Identify what's actually good vs. what to ignore

**Step 2: Define The Journey**
- Map the actual client phases (sales → onboard → design → launch → optimize → grow)
- For each phase, list: What's the goal? What does success look like? Who owns it?
- This becomes our skeleton

**Step 3: Identify Transcript Goldmines**
- Which clients best represent each phase? (most successful, most recent, most typical)
- Pull down those Fathom transcripts
- This is our source of truth

**Output:** One-page system map showing all phases + which transcripts to mine

---

## PHASE 2: Extract Truth (Days 4-7)

**Step 4: Mine Transcripts for Patterns**
- For each phase, extract from transcripts:
  - What Jordan actually says/does (not what he thinks he does)
  - Decision points (when do we pivot?)
  - Templates referenced (frameworks, worksheets, etc.)
  - Success patterns (what predicts good outcomes?)

**Step 5: Compare Theory vs. Reality**
- Take existing docs, overlay transcript reality
- Mark: What's accurate? What's outdated? What's missing?
- Identify gaps between "how we say we do it" and "how we actually do it"

**Output:** Phase-by-phase comparison showing theory vs. reality + what's working

---

## PHASE 3: Build Playbooks (Days 8-11)

**Step 6: Create Phase Playbooks**
Each phase gets ONE playbook (not a book, a playbook):

**Format per playbook:**
```
PHASE: [Name]
GOAL: [What we're trying to achieve]

STEPS: (Checklist format)
□ Step 1: Do X
  → Template: Link to X template
  → Quality check: How to know you did it right
□ Step 2: Do Y
  → Decision tree: If A, then B; if C, then D
  → Common mistake: Don't do Z

OUTPUTS: What client gets at end of this phase
HANDOFF: What next phase needs from you

KEY TEMPLATES: (3-5 max)
- Template 1
- Template 2

QUALITY CHECKLIST: (Pass/fail)
□ Did we do X?
□ Did client say/do Y?
□ Is Z in place?
```

**Anti-verbose rules:**
- No paragraphs > 3 lines
- Bullets > prose
- Checklists > explanations
- Templates > descriptions
- "Do this" > "You should consider doing this"

**Step 7: Document Decision Trees**
- When do we do X vs. Y? (Clear if/then logic)
- When do we escalate to Jordan? (Decision criteria)
- When do we use template A vs. B?

**Output:** 6 playbooks (one per phase) + decision trees + template library

---

## PHASE 4: Validate & Refine (Days 12-14)

**Step 8: Team Validation**
- Filip and Shannon review each playbook
- Test question: "Could you onboard the next client using only this?"
- Mark: What's missing? What's confusing? What's wrong?

**Step 9: Reality Test**
- Take current client work, map against playbooks
- Does it match? If not, update playbooks
- Goal: 95%+ accuracy vs. real client work

**Step 10: Usage Guide**
- How to use this system (one-pager)
- How to update it as you learn (living document)
- How to find answers fast (index/search strategy)

**Output:** Final playbook set validated by team + tested against reality

## How AI Will Be Used (The Right Way)

**AI FOR:**
- Extracting patterns from transcripts (feed transcripts, find what Jordan says repeatedly)
- Comparing old docs to transcript reality (gap analysis)
- Drafting checklists from messy notes (Harvey reviews/edits)
- Creating templates from examples (Harvey validates)

**AI NOT FOR:**
- Writing explanatory prose (Harvey writes, or no one writes)
- Making strategy decisions (Jordan/team decide)
- Creating content from scratch (transcript truth only)

---

## Working Mode: Out of Order OK

Jordan can feed inputs in any order that's convenient:
- "Here's a transcript from Luca onboarding"
- "Here's an old doc about launch phase"
- "Here's what I told Austin yesterday about X"

Harvey will:
1. Process whatever comes in
2. Map it to the right phase/step
3. Track what's complete vs. missing
4. Identify next gaps to fill

---

## Daily Check-In Protocol

Every day Harvey will:
1. Report progress (what's complete, what's blocked)
2. Identify highest-value next input needed
3. Show gap analysis (what phases/steps are still empty)
4. Flag: Are we on track for 2-week deadline?

---

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Truth from transcripts** - Not theory from old docs
2. **Usability over completeness** - Checklists not essays
3. **Team validation** - Must work for Filip/Shannon, not just Jordan
4. **95%+ accuracy** - Tested against real client work
5. **Daily momentum** - Work on this EVERY day for 2 weeks

---

**Status:** ACTIVE - Priority #1
**Next Action:** Jordan provides existing docs + client goldmines to mine
