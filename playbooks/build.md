# BUILD PLAYBOOK - Implementation & Pre-Sell Execution

**Use this when:** Design phase complete, ready to implement  
**Time needed:** 4-6 weeks  
**Goal:** Functioning Circle space + 5-10 founding members

---

## ⚡ 5-MINUTE OVERVIEW

**The Pre-Sell Methodology (NOT Build → Sell):**
1. **Reach out** to 5-10 ideal members (don't build yet)
2. **Sell on outcome** via serve calls (not features)
3. **Get money** + hear objections
4. **Build based on feedback** (what they actually need)

**Why this works:**
- Validates demand BEFORE building
- Surfaces real objections early
- Builds WITH customers, not FOR them
- Faster to revenue

**Key principle:** "You sell 100x better on a serve call than any sales page."

## 🌳 DECISION TREE: BUILD APPROACH

```
START: Design complete, ready to build
  ↓
DO YOU HAVE EXISTING AUDIENCE?
├─ YES: Pre-sell approach
│  ├─ Reach out to 5-10 ideal people
│  ├─ Serve calls (sell on outcome)
│  ├─ Get money FIRST
│  └─ Build WITH their input
│
└─ NO: Need to build + market
   ├─ Build minimum viable Circle
   ├─ Seed with basic content
   ├─ Launch to cold audience
   └─ Iterate based on feedback

RECOMMENDED: Pre-sell whenever possible (faster, validated)
```

---

## ✅ PRE-BUILD CHECKLIST

**Design outputs confirmed:**
- [ ] Promise statement locked
- [ ] Target avatar defined
- [ ] Pricing validated
- [ ] Deliverables clear
- [ ] Positioning finalized

**Ready to build:**
- [ ] Circle account created
- [ ] Payment processor connected
- [ ] List of 5-10 ideal beta members identified
- [ ] Team roles assigned (who builds what)

---

## 📞 PHASE 1: PRE-SELL (Week 1-2)

### Step 1: Identify Beta Candidates

**Who to reach out to:**
- [ ] People who've expressed interest
- [ ] Warm network (know/like/trust you)
- [ ] Ideal avatar match
- [ ] Can afford pricing
- [ ] Will give honest feedback

**How many:** 5-10 people (not 50)

**Why this number:**
- Small enough to serve personally
- Large enough to validate demand
- Can handle on serve calls
- Won't overwhelm you

---

### Step 2: Reach Out (Conversation-Based)

**Method:** Direct message, not mass email

**Outreach template:**
```
Hey [Name],

Quick question: I'm launching [transformation promise] for [target avatar].

It's [format] at [price]/month, starting [date].

Would this be valuable to you? Want to jump on a quick call to talk through it?

[Your Name]
```

**Key elements:**
- Personal (not blast)
- Specific (transformation, not features)
- Low commitment ask (call, not "buy now")
- Timing clear

**Real example (Austin):**
> Reached out to 5-10 chiropractors from Growth Summit
> "I'm helping 25-35K/month practices hit 50K WITHOUT diluting services. 
> Want to chat?"

---

### Step 3: Serve Calls (NOT Sales Calls)

**Goal:** Understand their problem, show how you'd solve it, handle objections, get commitment

**Serve call structure (30-45 min):**

**1. Discovery (10 min):**
```
"Tell me about your situation. Where are you at right now with [specific goal]?"

[Listen, take notes, capture exact language]
```

**2. Positioning (15 min):**
```
"Okay, here's what I'm thinking. I'd help you [transformation] by:
- [Deliverable 1]
- [Deliverable 2]
- [Deliverable 3]

The format is [membership/cohort], and it's [price]/month.

Does that sound like it would help?"
```

**3. Objection handling (10 min):**
```
"What concerns do you have? What would need to be true for this to be a 
no-brainer?"

[Address objections one at a time]
```

**4. Close (5 min):**
```
"So, are you in? Can I count you as one of the founding members?"

[If yes:]
"Awesome. I'll send you a payment link today. We start [date]."
```

**Key principle:** Handle objections ONE AT A TIME, move toward decision.

**Real example (Jordan's approach):**
> "You sell 100x better than a sales page. Get on calls, hear objections 
> live, adjust positioning real-time."

---

### Step 4: Get Money (Payment BEFORE Build)

**Don't:** Wait to build before charging

**Do:** Get payment, THEN build based on their input

**Payment setup:**
- [ ] Create Circle paywall link (simple)
- [ ] Set founding member price
- [ ] Send link after serve call
- [ ] Collect payment

**Why money first:**
- Validates real commitment (not just interest)
- Gives you runway to build properly
- Makes them invested in success
- Surfaces serious objections vs. polite interest

**Script:**
```
"Great! I'm sending you the payment link now. Once you're in, I'll add you 
to the founding member group where we'll co-create this together."
```

---

### Step 5: Capture Objections & Feedback

**After each serve call, document:**
- [ ] What objections came up?
- [ ] What pricing concerns?
- [ ] What format questions?
- [ ] What deliverables did they ask about?
- [ ] What language resonated?
- [ ] What didn't land?

**Use this to refine:**
- Positioning
- Pricing
- Deliverables
- Messaging

**Pattern:** Build based on REAL feedback, not assumptions.

---

## 🏗️ PHASE 2: MINIMAL VIABLE BUILD (Week 3-4)

### Goal: Build just enough to start

**Don't build:**
- ❌ Perfect landing page
- ❌ 100 pieces of content
- ❌ Complex automation
- ❌ Every feature you dreamed of

**Do build:**
- ✅ Simple Circle space structure
- ✅ Clear onboarding sequence
- ✅ First week of content
- ✅ Event calendar (first month)
- ✅ Simple payment link

---

### Step 1: Circle Space Structure

**Keep it simple:**
```
SPACES (3-5 max to start):
├─ 📌 START HERE (Onboarding + announcements)
├─ 💬 COMMUNITY (General discussion)
├─ 📚 RESOURCES (Content library)
├─ 📅 EVENTS (Calendar + recordings)
└─ ❓ SUPPORT (Q&A, help)
```

**Don't overthink categories.** You can change them later.

**Real example (Austin):**
> Jordan: "Don't worry about the perfect names. You can change them based on 
> what your members actually need."

---

### Step 2: Seed Content (Just Enough)

**What to seed:**
- [ ] Welcome video (3-5 min)
- [ ] First week of core content (3-5 posts)
- [ ] FAQ post (common questions)
- [ ] Member intro template

**Don't:** Create 3 months of content up front

**Do:** Create 1 week, add more as you go

**Why:** 
- Content needs will change based on members
- Better to iterate than pre-build wrong stuff
- Founding members expect beta experience

---

### Step 3: Event Calendar (First Month Only)

**What to schedule:**
- [ ] Welcome call (week 1)
- [ ] Weekly live session (format TBD)
- [ ] Office hours (optional)
- [ ] Next month placeholder

**Don't:** Build 6-month calendar up front

**Do:** Schedule first month, add as you learn what works

**Pattern:** Work happens ON calls (not homework)

**Real insight (Jordan):**
> "15 minutes teaching, 75 minutes doing work together. Execution happens 
> live with immediate help. Members get tangible progress each session."

---

### Step 4: Simple Payment Setup

**Use Circle paywall link (easiest):**
```
1. Circle → Settings → Payments
2. Create membership tier
3. Set founding member price
4. Generate paywall link
5. Send to beta members
```

**Don't:** Build Stripe integration, custom checkout, fancy landing page

**Do:** Use Circle's native payment (fast, simple, works)

---

## 👥 PHASE 3: OPERATIONAL SETUP (Week 5-6)

### Step 1: Define Team Roles

**Who does what:**
```
JORDAN (Strategy):
- Client relationship
- Big picture direction
- Complex problem-solving

FILIP (Technical):
- Circle implementation
- Automation setup
- Technical troubleshooting

SHANNON (Operations):
- Event coordination
- Member onboarding
- Day-to-day operations
```

**Document for client's team:**
```
CLIENT (Expert):
- Content creation
- Live teaching/facilitation
- Community presence

COMMUNITY MANAGER (if hired):
- Daily engagement
- Member onboarding
- Event logistics
```

---

### Step 2: Onboarding Sequence

**What new members experience:**
```
DAY 1:
- Receive welcome email
- Access Circle space
- See "Start Here" pinned post
- Invited to welcome call

WEEK 1:
- Attend welcome call
- Complete profile
- Intro post in community
- First live session

WEEK 2:
- Establish weekly routine
- Engage in discussions
- Access resources
```

**Build this sequence:**
- [ ] Welcome email template
- [ ] Start Here post (pinned)
- [ ] Profile setup guidance
- [ ] Weekly rhythm explained

---

### Step 3: Engagement Loops

**What keeps members active:**

**Daily:**
- [ ] Community manager posts prompts
- [ ] Expert/founder responds to questions
- [ ] Members tagged for contributions

**Weekly:**
- [ ] Live session (teaching + execution)
- [ ] Recap/highlights posted
- [ ] Next week preview

**Monthly:**
- [ ] Special event/guest
- [ ] Member spotlight
- [ ] Progress check-in

**Build the minimum loops, iterate based on engagement.**

---

## 🔄 PHASE 4: LAUNCH & ITERATE (Week 7-8)

### Step 1: Beta Launch (Founding Members Only)

**Announce launch:**
```
"We're live! Founding members get access today. Here's what to expect:

WEEK 1:
- Welcome call [date/time]
- First live session [date/time]
- Daily check-ins in community

THIS IS BETA:
- Things will evolve
- Your feedback shapes everything
- Founding member pricing locked forever

Let's build this together."
```

---

### Step 2: Work ON Calls (Not Homework)

**Format for live sessions:**
```
MINUTE 0-15: Teaching
- Introduce concept/framework
- Show examples
- Answer clarifying questions

MINUTE 15-90: Doing
- Members work on their actual business/problem
- You circulate and help
- Screen share, live coaching
- Tangible progress by end
```

**Why this works:**
- Immediate help when stuck
- Accountability to execute
- Real progress (not just learning)
- Community sees each other's work

**Real example (Jordan):**
> "We don't give homework. We do the work together on the call. You get 
> 15 minutes of teaching, then 75 minutes of execution with help. Way more 
> valuable than 'go do this and come back next week.'"

---

### Step 3: Iterate Based on Feedback

**After each session, ask:**
- [ ] What worked well?
- [ ] What didn't work?
- [ ] What would you change?
- [ ] What's missing?

**Adjust quickly:**
- Content format
- Event timing
- Deliverables
- Engagement approach

**Pattern:** Beta = permission to iterate fast

---

## 🔑 KEY FRAMEWORKS

### 1. Pre-Sell Methodology (GrowthCommunity Standard)

**Sequence:**
```
TRADITIONAL (Wrong):
Build → Launch → Sell → Iterate
↓
PROBLEMS:
- Built wrong thing
- No validation
- Wasted time/money
- Hard to pivot

GROWTHCOMMUNITY (Right):
Reach out → Sell → Build → Iterate
↓
BENEFITS:
- Validated demand
- Real objections surfaced
- Built with customers
- Faster to revenue
```

---

### 2. Serve Calls > Landing Pages

**Concept:** Sell via conversation, not sales page

**Why:**
- You sell 100x better than copy
- Can handle objections live
- Adjust positioning real-time
- Build relationship immediately

**When to use sales page:**
- After 20-30 serve calls (you know all objections)
- Scaling beyond your call capacity
- Inbound leads from content

**For beta:** Always start with serve calls.

---

### 3. Work ON Calls (Execution Model)

**Concept:** Don't assign homework, do work together

**Format:**
- 15 min teaching
- 75 min doing (together)
- Immediate help when stuck
- Tangible progress each session

**Why this works:**
- Accountability (they actually do it)
- Momentum (progress every week)
- Community (see each other work)
- Value (help when they need it)

---

### 4. Network vs. Transformation Model

**Two approaches:**

**Transformation Model:**
- Specific outcome (lose 20 lbs, launch business)
- Members "graduate" after achieving
- High churn by design
- Content/education focused

**Network Model:**
- Ongoing access to peers/experts
- No "graduation"
- Lower churn potential
- Connection/resources focused

**Decision:** Which fits your offer?

---

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

**Mistake 1: Building before validating**
- Spend 6 weeks building, nobody buys
- Solution: Pre-sell FIRST, build SECOND

**Mistake 2: Perfect landing page syndrome**
- Obsess over copy/design instead of selling
- Solution: Use Circle paywall link, serve calls only

**Mistake 3: Creating too much content up front**
- 100 posts nobody asked for
- Solution: Seed 1 week, add based on needs

**Mistake 4: Homework instead of execution**
- "Go do this and report back"
- Solution: Work ON calls with immediate help

**Mistake 5: Complex automation too early**
- Fancy workflows before knowing what works
- Solution: Manual first, automate later

---

## 📋 BUILD PHASE OUTPUTS (Checklist)

**By end of build phase, must have:**
- [ ] **5-10 paying founding members**
- [ ] **Circle space configured** (3-5 spaces minimum)
- [ ] **First week content seeded**
- [ ] **Event calendar** (first month scheduled)
- [ ] **Team roles documented**
- [ ] **Onboarding sequence built**
- [ ] **Payment link working**
- [ ] **Engagement loops defined**

**If ANY of these missing:** Don't move to LAUNCH phase yet.
