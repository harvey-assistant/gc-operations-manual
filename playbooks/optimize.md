# OPTIMIZE PLAYBOOK - Weekly Operations & Growth

**Use this when:** Community launched and stabilized  
**Time needed:** Ongoing (weekly syncs)  
**Goal:** Improve retention, fix friction, scale what works

---

## ⚡ 5-MINUTE OVERVIEW

**Weekly Sync Formula (30-45 min):**
1. **Action items review** (5 min) - What got done?
2. **Metrics check** (5 min) - Growth, engagement, churn
3. **Issues & blockers** (15 min) - What's broken?
4. **Prioritization** (10 min) - What's most important this week?
5. **Wins & next steps** (5 min) - Celebrate + focus

**Key principle:** Short, focused, action-oriented (not status updates).

## ✅ WEEKLY SYNC TEMPLATE

### Attendees
- Client (community owner)
- Jordan/Filip/Shannon (GrowthCommunity team)
- Community manager (if hired)

### Duration
30-45 minutes (not 60+)

### Format
Video call, recorded via Fathom for notes

---

### Agenda

**SECTION 1: Action Items Review (5 min)**

```
"What did we commit to last week? Let's check status."

FOR EACH ACTION ITEM:
□ Done? ✅
□ In progress? 🟡 (new timeline)
□ Blocked? 🔴 (what's blocking)
□ Dropped? ❌ (why)
```

**Don't skip this.** Accountability matters.

---

**SECTION 2: Metrics Check (5 min)**

```
GROWTH:
- New members this week: [#]
- Total active members: [#]
- Growth rate: [%]

ENGAGEMENT:
- Event attendance: [#] (up/down from last week)
- Posts created: [#] (member posts, not admin)
- Active %: [%] (engaged this week)

CHURN:
- Cancellations this week: [#]
- Churn rate: [%]
- Top churn reason: [from exit surveys]

REVENUE:
- MRR: $[amount]
- New MRR: $[from new members]
- Churned MRR: $[from cancellations]
- Net MRR change: $[net]
```

**Look for trends, not single-week blips.**

---

**SECTION 3: Issues & Blockers (15 min)**

```
"What's broken? What's slowing us down? What needs attention?"

[Go around the table, everyone shares]

JORDAN/FILIP/SHANNON: [Issues from our side]
CLIENT: [Issues from their side]
COMMUNITY MANAGER: [Issues from operations]

FOR EACH ISSUE:
- What's the impact? (Critical / Important / Nice to have)
- Root cause? (Don't just treat symptoms)
- Who can solve? (Assign owner)
- Timeline? (This week / Next week / Backlog)
```

**Prioritize ruthlessly.** Can't fix everything at once.

---

**SECTION 4: Prioritization (10 min)**

```
"Of everything we just discussed, what are the TOP 3 priorities for this week?"

PRIORITY 1: [Most critical thing]
- Owner: [Name]
- Done by: [Date]
- Success looks like: [Specific outcome]

PRIORITY 2: [Second most critical]
- Owner: [Name]
- Done by: [Date]
- Success looks like: [Specific outcome]

PRIORITY 3: [Third most critical]
- Owner: [Name]
- Done by: [Date]
- Success looks like: [Specific outcome]

EVERYTHING ELSE: Backlog (revisit next week if still important)
```

**Limit to 3.** More than 3 = nothing gets done.

---

**SECTION 5: Wins & Next Steps (5 min)**

```
"What went well this week? What are we celebrating?"

[Quick round of wins, keep it positive]

NEXT MEETING: [Same day/time next week]

HOMEWORK:
- You: [Specific deliverable if any]
- Us: [What we're preparing]
```

**End on a positive note.**

---

## 🚪 CHURN MANAGEMENT

### Exit Survey Setup

**Two cancellation paths:**

**Path 1: Managed (WITH survey):**
```
Member clicks "Manage Account" link
  ↓
Tally form: "What would you like to do?"
  ├─ Update payment → Redirect to Circle billing
  └─ Cancel subscription → Exit survey
```

**Path 2: Direct (BYPASS survey):**
```
Member goes to profile → Billing → Cancel
  ↓
Skips exit survey
```

**Strategy:**
- Enable self-cancellation (don't force permission)
- Make managed path prominent in FAQs
- Accept not everyone will fill survey (maybe 50-70%)
- Capture what you can

**Jake's wisdom:**
> "We're okay with some percentage not filling it out. We make the FAQs 
> prominent with the link, and we get what we can. Can't force 100%."

---

### Exit Survey Questions

**Question 1: Why are you leaving?** (Multiple choice)
- [ ] Too expensive
- [ ] Not enough value
- [ ] Not enough time
- [ ] Found another solution
- [ ] Other: [text field]

**Question 2: What would have made you stay?** (Free text)

**Question 3: How likely to recommend?** (NPS 0-10 scale)

**Question 4: Can we follow up?** (Email for potential win-back)

---

### Analyzing Churn

**Monthly churn review:**
```
1. Pull exit survey responses
2. Group by reason (category breakdown)
3. Identify patterns:
   - One reason dominating? (fix that)
   - Multiple scattered reasons? (broader issue)
   - No clear pattern? (natural churn, acceptable)

4. Prioritize fixes:
   - HIGH: Affects >30% of churners
   - MEDIUM: Affects 10-30%
   - LOW: One-off issues
```

**Don't try to save everyone.** Some churn is natural.

---

## 🔧 AUTOMATION MAINTENANCE

### Pattern: Monitor → Report → Fix → Verify

**Common automation issues:**

**Issue 1: Members not removed after cancellation**
- **Symptom:** Canceled members still have access
- **Cause:** Circle payment sync issues, migration edge cases
- **Fix:** Manual daily audit until Circle resolves
- **Prevention:** Weekly automation health check

**Issue 2: Onboarding tags not applying**
- **Symptom:** Can't filter who scheduled calls
- **Cause:** Calendly → Circle integration broken
- **Fix:** Rebuild Make.com scenario
- **Prevention:** Test automation monthly

**Issue 3: Squad assignments wrong**
- **Symptom:** Members in wrong groups
- **Cause:** Profile questions changed, logic outdated
- **Fix:** Update Make.com logic, re-run assignments
- **Prevention:** Document profile → assignment mapping

---

### Filip's Approach (Realize Jan 28)

**Problem:** Members not getting kicked after cancellation

**Response:**
> "I've checked the workflows... I cannot identify any pattern. So I've 
> reached out to Circle support. Until then, I can just hop in daily and 
> manually kick them out."

**Key principle:** Manual workaround while investigating > letting members stay after canceling.

---

## 👥 TEAM SCALING

### Pattern: Bottleneck → Document → Hire → Train

**When to hire:**

**Hiring trigger checklist:**
- [ ] Bottleneck identified (one person overwhelmed)
- [ ] Bottleneck documented (what tasks, how much time)
- [ ] Can't automate (already tried)
- [ ] Revenue supports salary
- [ ] Role clearly defined

**Don't hire until all 5 are YES.**

---

### Real Example: Realize Team Scaling

**Hire 1: Pod Coordinator (Stephanie)**
- **Trigger:** Jake spending 10+ hours/week on pod placements
- **Solution:** Contract experienced facilitator as coordinator
- **Result:** Jake's time freed, smoother placements

**Hire 2: Dedicated Facilitators (Next hire)**
- **Trigger:** Busy firm owners can't commit to 90-min sessions
- **Solution:** Hire people whose job IS facilitation
- **Result:** Consistent quality, scalable model

**Jake's realization:**
> "The next hire is probably somebody whose dedicated job is just to be a 
> facilitator of 90-minute sessions, not firm owners who are busy."

---

### Hiring Principle

**Document BEFORE hiring:**
```
ROLE: [Title]

BOTTLENECK:
- Current owner: [Name]
- Time spent: [Hours/week]
- Tasks: [List]

NEW ROLE RESPONSIBILITIES:
- Task 1: [Specific]
- Task 2: [Specific]
- Task 3: [Specific]

SUCCESS METRICS:
- Metric 1: [Measurable]
- Metric 2: [Measurable]

COMPENSATION:
- $[amount] or [% revenue share]
```

**If you can't fill this out, you're not ready to hire.**

---

## 📈 ENGAGEMENT OPTIMIZATION

### Pattern: Measure → Experiment → Double Down

**What to optimize:**

**1. Event Attendance**
- **Track:** Attendance rate per event type
- **Experiment:** Different days/times, formats, topics
- **Double down:** Scale what works, kill what doesn't

**2. Post Engagement**
- **Track:** Comments per post, reaction rate
- **Experiment:** Question formats, prompts, challenges
- **Double down:** Templates for high-engagement posts

**3. First-Week Experience**
- **Track:** % completing onboarding, first event attended
- **Experiment:** Onboarding length, nudge timing
- **Double down:** Smooth path that converts to active

**4. Pod/Mastermind Retention**
- **Track:** Attendance rate, completion rate
- **Experiment:** Facilitator training, agenda formats
- **Double down:** Best facilitators, proven agendas

---

### Experimentation Framework

**One big experiment per week:**
```
WEEK: [Date]
EXPERIMENT: [What we're testing]
HYPOTHESIS: [What we think will happen]
SUCCESS METRIC: [How we measure]
RESULT: [What actually happened]
DECISION: [Scale / Kill / Iterate]
```

**Don't optimize 5 things at once.** Can't tell what worked.

---

## 💬 MEMBER FEEDBACK LOOPS

### Pattern: Ask → Listen → Act → Tell

**How to collect feedback:**

**1. Exit Surveys** (required for managed cancellation)
- Analyze quarterly
- Group by themes

**2. Periodic Check-Ins**
- NPS survey (quarterly)
- "How are we doing?" DM (monthly to random sample)
- Post-event feedback (after major events)

**3. Community Listening**
- What questions come up repeatedly?
- What features do people request?
- What complaints surface?

**4. Team Observations**
- What breaks? What's smooth?
- What takes too much time?
- What delights members?

---

### Close the Loop

**DON'T:** Ask for feedback you won't act on

**DO:** Tell them what you did with their feedback

**Script:**
```
"Last month, 15 of you said [specific feedback]. We heard you.

Here's what we built: [Solution]

Thanks for making this community better!"
```

**Members need to see feedback = action.**

---

## 🔄 CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT CYCLE

**4-Week Iteration Cycle:**

**Week 1:** Identify friction point  
**Week 2:** Experiment with fix  
**Week 3:** Measure result  
**Week 4:** Scale or kill

**Example (Realize Jan 2026):**
- **Friction:** Exit survey bypass
- **Experiment:** Prominent FAQ link to managed flow
- **Measure:** Survey completion rate
- **Result:** TBD (just implemented)

**Example (Austin Dec 2025):**
- **Friction:** Pre-launch, building too much
- **Experiment:** Pre-sell first, build after
- **Measure:** 5-10 sign-ups before building
- **Result:** ✅ Validated demand, built with feedback

---

## ⚠️ COMMON OPTIMIZE MISTAKES

**Mistake 1: Not tracking churn reasons**
- Flying blind on why people leave
- Solution: Exit survey, analyze quarterly

**Mistake 2: Building before validating**
- Spend weeks on features nobody wants
- Solution: Ask → Test → Build

**Mistake 3: Ignoring support volume**
- Same questions over and over
- Solution: FAQ, automation, documentation

**Mistake 4: Not firing bad facilitators**
- One bad experience kills retention
- Solution: Evaluate, train, replace if needed

**Mistake 5: Optimizing too many things at once**
- Can't tell what worked
- Solution: One big thing per week

---

## 🔑 KEY FRAMEWORKS

### 1. Short Weekly Syncs

**Concept:** 30-45 min, focused on action (not status updates)

**Why it works:**
- Keeps team aligned
- Surfaces issues fast
- Forces prioritization
- Creates momentum

**Anti-pattern:** 90-min meandering status meetings

---

### 2. Manual Workarounds While Investigating

**Concept:** Don't wait for perfect fix, manually handle while debugging

**Filip's approach:**
> "I cannot identify the pattern, so I've reached out to Circle. Until then, 
> I'll manually check daily and kick out canceled members."

**Why it works:**
- Problem gets handled NOW
- Doesn't block progress
- Root cause investigation happens in parallel

---

### 3. One Big Thing Per Week

**Concept:** Limit improvements to 1 major thing per week

**Why it works:**
- Can measure what moved the needle
- Team stays focused
- Compound improvements over time

**Anti-pattern:** 10 initiatives, nothing ships

---

## 📊 OPTIMIZE SUCCESS METRICS

**Month 1-3 (Stabilize):**
- Churn <8%
- Support load manageable
- Automations working
- Team not overwhelmed

**Month 4-6 (Improve):**

- Event attendance growing
- NPS >40
- First hires made

**Month 7-12 (Scale):**
- Churn <5%
- Multiple cohorts running
- Team operating smoothly
- Revenue growing
