# SALES PLAYBOOK - Discovery Call Execution

**Use this when:** You have a discovery call with a potential client  
**Time needed:** 30-45 minutes  
**Goal:** Qualify fit, demonstrate value, book next step

## ⚡ 5-MINUTE OVERVIEW

**The Discovery Formula:**
1. **Rapport** (2 min) - Connect naturally
2. **Discovery** (15 min) - Let THEM talk, you listen
3. **Validation** (2 min) - Affirm what's working
4. **Positioning** (10 min) - Show visual examples
5. **Qualification** (2 min) - Check fit (budget, timeline, readiness)
6. **Soft Close** (1 min) - Book follow-up, no pressure

**Key principle:** You're evaluating THEM as much as they're evaluating you.

## ✅ PRE-CALL CHECKLIST

**Do this 1 hour before call:**
- [ ] Review their intake form/background
- [ ] Identify: Type 1 (optimize existing) or Type 2 (build new)?
- [ ] Find 2-3 relevant client examples to show
- [ ] Have comparison clients in mind (Exit Five, Realize, etc.)
- [ ] Clear 45 minutes, no distractions
- [ ] Screen share ready (Circle examples)
- [ ] Notebook ready to capture verbatim language

---

## 📞 DURING THE CALL: 6-STEP SEQUENCE

### STEP 1: RAPPORT (1-2 min)

**Goal:** Connection, ease, warmth

**Script:**
```
"Hey [Name]! How are you? Where are you calling from?"

[Natural conversation about their location, weather, etc.]

"Great energy - thanks for taking the time to chat."
```

**Don't:** Rush this. Let it be natural.

---

### STEP 2: DISCOVERY (15-20 min)

**Goal:** Let THEM explain everything - current state, goals, challenges

**Opening question (pick one):**
```
✅ "What was the main motivation behind reaching out?"
✅ "Walk me through what you're up to."
✅ "Fill me in - what's going on?"
```

**Then SHUT UP and listen for 10-15 minutes.**

**Follow-up questions (as needed):**
```
□ "Who's the community for and what are you helping them do?"
□ "How much are you charging them?"
□ "How many members do you have?"
□ "What would you say your biggest goals are?"
□ "Is this scale fast and sell in 12 months, or build to $200K/month?"
□ "What would be some of the biggest challenges you'd want to tackle?"
□ "What's working well right now?"
□ "What's not working?"
```

**Key principle:** Ask open-ended, let them show you everything. Don't jump to solutions yet.

**What to listen for:**
- [ ] Problems in their exact words (write these down verbatim)
- [ ] What they've tried before
- [ ] Why now? (timing/urgency)
- [ ] Budget signals
- [ ] Red flags (not the expert, no audience, etc.)

---

### STEP 3: VALIDATION (2-3 min)

**Goal:** Affirm what's working, build confidence, position as peer

**Validation phrases:**
```
✅ "You're killing it already"
✅ "You're in the top 10-20% just by [specific thing they're doing]"
✅ "That's really impressive - most people don't [X]"
✅ "You've figured out the hardest part already"
✅ "I appreciate that background - really helpful"
```

**Real example:**
> Jake (Realize): Built accounting community to 500 members, $75K/month
> Jordan: "You're killing it already. Most people never get past 100 members."

**Why this matters:** People come feeling inadequate. Validation opens them up.

---

### STEP 4: POSITIONING (10-15 min)

**Goal:** Show offering, demonstrate expertise, use visual examples

**Method: SHOW DON'T TELL**

**Step 4A: Share screen**
```
"Let me show you what we did with [similar client]."
```

**Step 4B: Pull up relevant example:**
- **Type 1 (Optimize):** Show Realize (Jake Kessenich) - 709 members, 80% active
- **Type 2 (Build new):** Show Exit Five (Dave Gerhardt) - 7-figure community
- **Other:** AI Finance Club, Ness Labs, depending on vertical

**Step 4C: Walk through 3-5 quick wins:**
```
"Here's what we'd do in the first 30 days..."
├─ Week 1: [Specific thing]
├─ Week 2: [Specific thing]
└─ Week 3: [Specific thing]
```

**Positioning phrases:**
```
✅ "Here's what we do..."
✅ "The way I think about it is..."
✅ "I've seen this work really well when..."
✅ "This is what [similar client] is doing - does this resonate?"
```

**Key principle:** Visual beats verbal. Show them a working example.

---

### STEP 5: QUALIFICATION (2-3 min)

**Goal:** Ensure fit - budget, timeline, readiness

**Qualification questions:**
```
□ "Does this sound like alignment with what you're looking for - budget, timeline?"
□ "Are you ready to move forward on something like this?"
□ "What would need to be true for this to be a no-brainer?"
```

**Budget discussion:**
```
"Our model is $6,000 a month or 30% of the new revenue we help you 
generate, whichever is greater. 

In the beginning, you'll be paying the $6K minimum while we're building. 
But our goal is to grow your revenue to the point where that 30% becomes 
more than $6K - because that means we're actually moving the needle. 

And at that point, you're only paying us out of revenue you wouldn't have 
had without us, so it becomes completely self-funding."
```

**Red flags to watch for:**
- [ ] Not the expert/authority in their space ⚠️
- [ ] No audience/network to start with ⚠️
- [ ] Not passionate about the topic ⚠️
- [ ] Budget concerns (can't afford $4K+/month) ⚠️
- [ ] Timeline mismatch ⚠️
- [ ] Unclear on their offer/who they serve ⚠️

**If 2+ red flags:** Politely decline or suggest different approach.

---

### STEP 6: SOFT CLOSE (1-2 min)

**Goal:** Book next step without pressure

**Closing script:**
```
"I think there's a lot we could do here. Want to continue this conversation?"

[If yes:]
"Great - let's book a follow-up for later this week. I'll send you a calendar link."

[If hesitant:]
"No pressure at all. Take some time to think about it, and let me know if you want to chat more."
```

**No hard close. No pressure. Just natural next step.**

---

## 🎯 KEY FRAMEWORKS TO USE

### 1. "Opera Singer Breaking Glass"
Use their EXACT words back to them. Visceral reaction.

**Example:**
- They say: "I want to break the million dollar mark"
- You say: "So the goal is to break that million dollar mark" (exact words)
- DON'T say: "grow your business" (generic)

### 2. Problems-First (Not Ideas-First)
Sequence: Problem → Who → Solution → Idea

**Example:**
- ❌ "I want to build a community for entrepreneurs"
- ✅ "Entrepreneurs are struggling with [specific problem]. I want to help them [specific outcome]."

### 3. Enemy Positioning
Define what you're NOT as important as what you ARE.

**Example:**
- Realize: "NOT general accounting community, FOR firm owners running $1M+ practices"
