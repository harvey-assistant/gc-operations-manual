# DESIGN PLAYBOOK - Strategy Session Execution

**Use this when:** Type 2 client (building from scratch) after kickoff  
**Time needed:** 3-4 weeks, multiple sessions  
**Goal:** Crystal clear positioning, offer, and pricing

---

## ⚡ 5-MINUTE OVERVIEW

**The Design Journey (3-4 weeks):**
1. **Week 1:** Outcomes clarification → 10% clear
2. **Week 2:** Target audience definition → 50% clear
3. **Week 3:** Offer structure + pricing → 99% clear
4. **Week 4:** Customer validation + finalization

**Three session formats:**
- **Iterative** (Multiple short sessions) - Austin Cohen model
- **Structured Workshop** (90-min intensive) - Luca Rossi model
- **Strategy Brief** (Async scaffold) - Anne-Laure model

**Key principle:** Start at 10% clarity, iterate to 99% over 3-4 weeks.

## 🌳 DECISION TREE: DESIGN SESSION FORMAT

```
START: Client is Type 2 (Build from Scratch)
  ↓
WHICH FORMAT?
├─ ITERATIVE (Jordan-led, multiple short calls)
│  ├─ When: Client needs hand-holding, lots of uncertainty
│  ├─ Time: 3-4 sessions over 2 weeks
│  ├─ Outcome: Build clarity through conversation
│  └─ Example: Austin Cohen (Nov 7 sessions)
│
├─ STRUCTURED WORKSHOP (Filip-led, 90-min intensive)
│  ├─ When: Client is experienced, responds well to frameworks
│  ├─ Time: Single 90-min session with prep
│  ├─ Outcome: Use empathy mapping + frameworks
│  └─ Example: Luca Rossi (Feb 4 workshop)
│
└─ STRATEGY BRIEF (Async scaffold + review)
   ├─ When: Client is strategic thinker, prefers solo work
   ├─ Time: You draft brief, they review/refine
   ├─ Outcome: Comprehensive written strategy
   └─ Example: Anne-Laure (Jan 20 brief)
```

## 📋 FORMAT 1: ITERATIVE DESIGN (Jordan Model)

### Overview
- **Who runs:** Jordan typically
- **Sessions:** 3-4 calls over 2 weeks (30-60 min each)
- **Best for:** Clients who need conversational clarity
- **Example:** Austin Cohen Nov 7 sessions

### Session 1: Outcomes Clarification (10% Clear)

**Goal:** Get crystal clear on transformation you're selling

**Prep:**
- [ ] Review kickoff notes
- [ ] Review intake form outcomes
- [ ] Prepare clarifying questions

**Opening:**
```
"Last time we talked about these outcomes: [list them]. Let's dig into these 
and make sure we're clear on what transformation we're really selling."
```

**Key questions:**
```
□ "What outcomes matter MOST to your people?"
□ "Which outcome would sell the most seats?"
□ "What transformation do they want most?"
□ "What are they trying to avoid?"
□ "What's the gap between where they are and where they want to be?"
□ "What are they currently doing that doesn't work?"
```

**Listen for:**
- [ ] Verbatim customer language
- [ ] What they're ESCAPING (enemy positioning)
- [ ] Quantifiable gaps (numbers, metrics)
- [ ] Conflicts between outcomes

**Output:**
- [ ] Top 3 outcomes prioritized
- [ ] Transformation statement drafted
- [ ] Enemy positioning identified

**Real example (Austin Cohen):**
> Initial: "Help chiropractors scale to $1M"
> Refined: "Help 250-300K/year chiropractors hit 50K/month WITHOUT diluting 
> services or selling their soul"

---

### Session 2: Target Audience Definition (50% Clear)

**Goal:** Define WHO specifically you're serving

**Prep:**
- [ ] Review session 1 notes
- [ ] Draft initial avatar based on their language

**Opening:**
```
"Okay, we know the transformation. Now let's get super specific on WHO this 
is for. Paint me a picture of the ideal person."
```

**Key questions:**
```
□ "Who exactly is this for?"
□ "What's their current revenue/size?"
□ "Where do they want to be?"
□ "What have they already tried?"
□ "What are they frustrated with?"
□ "What makes someone ready vs. not ready?"
```

**Framework: Current State → Desired State**
```
CURRENT STATE:
- Revenue: [specific range]
- Problem: [in their words]
- Failed solutions: [what didn't work]
- Frustration: [exact language]

DESIRED STATE:
- Revenue: [target]
- Transformation: [what changes]
- Success looks like: [specific outcomes]
- Timeline: [how fast]
```

**Output:**
- [ ] Current state defined (with numbers)
- [ ] Desired state defined (with numbers)
- [ ] Gap quantified
- [ ] Avatar documented in their language

**Real example (Austin Cohen):**
> **Current:** $25-35K/month chiropractors stuck at plateau
> **Desired:** $50K/month without services dilution
> **Gap:** "Most will never get past 300K/year mark"

---

### Session 3: Offer Structure + Pricing (99% Clear)

**Goal:** Define what you're selling and how much

**Prep:**
- [ ] Review sessions 1-2 notes
- [ ] Draft 2-3 offer structure options
- [ ] Research comparable pricing

**Opening:**
```
"We know WHO and WHAT transformation. Now let's figure out the HOW - what 
format serves this best, and what's the right price point."
```

**Offer structure questions:**
```
□ "What format best delivers this transformation?"
   └─ Membership? Cohort? Hybrid?

□ "What's included? What's NOT included?"
   └─ Content? Community? Coaching? Events?

□ "What's the time commitment for members?"
   └─ How much time can they realistically invest?

□ "What makes this different from alternatives?"
   └─ What are they escaping?
```

**Pricing methodology:**

**Step 1: Outcome-based pricing**
```
"What's the VALUE of the transformation?"

Example: $50K/month = $600K/year
If membership helps them get there, what % of that value is fair?
→ Even 1% = $6,000/year = $500/month

Frame: "What would you pay to reliably hit $50K/month?"
```

**Step 2: Stair-step approach (Alex Hormozi model)**
```
START LOW:
- First 10-50 people: $47-75/month (founding member pricing)
- Validate demand, get testimonials, iron out kinks

INCREASE GRADUALLY:
- Next 50: Increase 10% → $52-83/month
- Next 50: Increase 10% → $57-91/month
- Next 50: Increase 10% → $63-100/month

RATIONALE:
- Early adopters take risk → rewarded with lower price
- Increased confidence → justified price increases
- Creates FOMO (price goes up soon)
```

**Step 3: Personal budget threshold**
```
SWEET SPOT: <$100/month
- Doesn't require spouse approval
- Can expense or pay personally
- "Impulse buy" territory for professionals

DANGER ZONE: >$150/month
- Requires justification
- Higher churn risk
- Harder sell
```

**Output:**
- [ ] Offer format decided
- [ ] Deliverables defined
- [ ] Pricing validated
- [ ] Positioning locked

**Real example (Luca Feb 4):**
> **Offer:** Membership (not cohort)
> **Deliverables:** Weekly content drops, community, quarterly live events
> **Pricing:** $47-75/month start, stair-step to $100
> **Positioning:** "Make your team ship faster" (not "grow your career")

---

### Session 4: Validation + Finalization

**Goal:** Test with real customers, lock in final decisions

**Prep:**
- [ ] Draft messaging for testing
- [ ] Identify 5-10 people to validate with

**Process:**
```
1. Reach out to 5-10 ideal customers
2. Pitch the transformation (not features)
3. Ask: "Would you pay $X/month for this?"
4. Listen for objections
5. Refine based on feedback
```

**Validation script:**
```
"Hey [Name], quick question:

I'm working on [transformation statement] for [target avatar]. 

The format is [offer structure], and it's $X/month.

Honest feedback: Would this be valuable to you? Any hesitations?"
```

**What to listen for:**
- [ ] Price objections (too high? too low?)
- [ ] Format objections (wrong delivery method?)
- [ ] Transformation objections (not the right outcome?)
- [ ] Timing objections (not ready? urgency missing?)

**Output:**
- [ ] Final pricing confirmed
- [ ] Messaging refined based on objections
- [ ] 2-5 early commitments (ideally)
- [ ] Green light to BUILD phase

## 📋 FORMAT 2: STRUCTURED WORKSHOP (Filip Model)

### Overview
- **Who runs:** Filip (or Jordan)
- **Duration:** 90 minutes intensive
- **Best for:** Experienced clients who respond to frameworks
- **Example:** Luca Rossi Feb 4 workshop

### Workshop Structure

**Prep (30 min before):**
- [ ] Review kickoff notes
- [ ] Prepare empathy mapping canvas
- [ ] Have framework slides ready

**Section 1: Empathy Mapping (30 min)**

**Framework: SAY → THINK → FEEL → DO** (Jake Wysocki method)

```
QUADRANT 1: WHAT DO THEY SAY?
"What words do your ideal customers use to describe their problem?"
[Capture exact phrases, verbatim language]

QUADRANT 2: WHAT DO THEY THINK?
"What's going through their head? Internal dialogue?"
[Deeper beliefs, assumptions, fears]

QUADRANT 3: WHAT DO THEY FEEL?
"What emotions are they experiencing?"
[Frustration, anxiety, hope, desperation]

QUADRANT 4: WHAT DO THEY DO?
"What actions are they taking (or not taking)?"
[Behaviors, workarounds, failed solutions]
```

**Output:**
- [ ] Empathy map completed
- [ ] Customer language captured
- [ ] Problem deeply understood

---

**Section 2: Promise Statement Refinement (30 min)**

**Jake Wysocki's "Brain on Speakerphone" method:**

```
STEP 1: Write initial promise
"We help [WHO] achieve [WHAT]"

STEP 2: Make thinking visible
- What assumptions am I making?
- What am I taking for granted?
- What needs to be more specific?

STEP 3: Refine based on questions
- Is WHO specific enough?
- Is WHAT quantifiable?
- Is this believable?
- Does it differentiate from alternatives?

STEP 4: Test for clarity
"If I told this to an ideal customer, would they immediately say 
'That's exactly what I need'?"
```

**Real example (Luca workshop):**
> Initial: "Help engineering managers be better leaders"
> Refined: "Make your team ship faster" (outcome-focused, quantifiable)

**Output:**
- [ ] Promise statement refined
- [ ] Customer reaction tested
- [ ] Differentiation clear

---

**Section 3: Offer Design + Pricing (30 min)**

**Use WHO → PROBLEMS → PROMISE → DELIVERABLES → PRICING sequence:**

```
WHO: [From empathy map]
PROBLEMS: [From empathy map]
PROMISE: [From refinement]

DELIVERABLES:
- What do they need to achieve the promise?
- What's the minimum viable offer?
- What's nice-to-have vs. must-have?

PRICING:
- Outcome value calculation
- Stair-step approach (start low, increase)
- Personal budget threshold (<$100/month)
```

**Output:**
- [ ] Offer structure decided
- [ ] Deliverables prioritized
- [ ] Pricing validated
- [ ] Next steps clear

## 📋 FORMAT 3: STRATEGY BRIEF (Async Model)

### Overview
- **Who runs:** Jordan drafts, client reviews
- **Duration:** 1-2 days draft, 1 hour review call
- **Best for:** Strategic thinkers who prefer solo work
- **Example:** Anne-Laure Jan 20 brief

### Process

**Step 1: Draft Strategy Brief (Jordan)**

**Brief structure:**
```markdown
# [CLIENT NAME] STRATEGY BRIEF

## CURRENT STATE
- Business overview
- Audience size/makeup
- Revenue model
- What's working
- What's broken

## GOALS
- North Star (big picture)
- 6-month targets (specific)
- Key metrics (what we measure)

## POSITIONING
- WHO (target avatar)
- WHAT (transformation promise)
- HOW (offer structure)
- WHY NOW (timing/urgency)
- ENEMY (what we're NOT)

## OFFER STRUCTURE
- Format (membership/cohort/hybrid)
- Deliverables (what's included)
- Pricing (with rationale)
- Launch timeline

## NEXT 90 DAYS
- Month 1: [Focus areas]
- Month 2: [Focus areas]
- Month 3: [Focus areas]

## OPEN QUESTIONS
- [What needs client input]
- [Areas of uncertainty]
- [Decisions to make]
```

**Drafting time:** 2-4 hours

---

**Step 2: Client Review (Async)**

Send brief with this framing:
```
"I've drafted a strategy brief based on our kickoff. This is 50% baked - 
there's a bunch I got right, and probably a bunch I got wrong.

Read through it and mark up anything that doesn't feel right. I'd rather 
you tear it apart now than nod along and regret it later.

Let's schedule a call for [date/time] to walk through your feedback."
```

**Client marks up:**
- [ ] What resonates
- [ ] What's off
- [ ] What's missing
- [ ] Questions/concerns

---

**Step 3: Review Call (60 min)**

**Agenda:**
```
1. What resonated (5 min)
2. What felt off (15 min)
3. What's missing (10 min)
4. Refine together (20 min)
5. Lock in decisions (10 min)
```

**Output:**
- [ ] Final strategy brief
- [ ] All decisions locked
- [ ] Green light to BUILD phase

---

## 🔑 KEY FRAMEWORKS (Jake Wysocki Design Thinking)

### 1. Empathy Mapping (SAY/THINK/FEEL/DO)

**Purpose:** Deeply understand customer beyond surface problem

```
┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
│  SAY        │  THINK      │
│  (external) │  (internal) │
├─────────────┼─────────────┤
│  FEEL       │  DO         │
│  (emotions) │  (actions)  │
└─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

**Use when:** Need to get beyond stated problem to real need

---

### 2. "Brain on Speakerphone"

**Purpose:** Make invisible thinking visible, surface assumptions

**Method:**
```
1. Make a claim/statement
2. Ask: "What am I assuming here?"
3. Test: "Is that assumption valid?"
4. Refine: "What would make this more accurate?"
5. Repeat until clear
```

**Use when:** Positioning feels vague or generic

---

### 3. Promise Statement Refinement

**Purpose:** Create clear, compelling transformation promise

**Format:**
```
"We help [WHO] achieve [WHAT] without [ENEMY]"

WHERE:
- WHO = Specific current state avatar
- WHAT = Quantifiable desired state
- ENEMY = What they're escaping/avoiding
```

**Test:**
- [ ] Would ideal customer immediately say "That's me!"?
- [ ] Is it differentiated from alternatives?
- [ ] Is transformation quantifiable?
- [ ] Is it believable?

---

### 4. Stair-Step Pricing (Alex Hormozi)

**Purpose:** Start low, validate, increase as confidence grows

```
FOUNDING MEMBERS (First 10-50):
→ $47-75/month
→ Take most risk, get best deal

COHORT 2 (Next 50):
→ Increase 10% → $52-83/month
→ Social proof now exists

COHORT 3 (Next 50):
→ Increase 10% → $57-91/month
→ Proven model, testimonials

TARGET STEADY STATE:
→ $97-150/month
→ After 3-4 cohorts, settle here
```

**Rationale:**
- Early adopters rewarded for risk
- Price increases create FOMO
- Incremental validation builds confidence
- Can always adjust based on market response

---

## 📊 DESIGN PHASE OUTPUTS (Checklist)

**By end of design phase, must have:**
- [ ] **Target Avatar:** Current state → Desired state (with numbers)
- [ ] **Transformation Promise:** One-sentence clear statement
- [ ] **Offer Structure:** Format decided (membership/cohort/hybrid)
- [ ] **Deliverables:** What's included, what's not
- [ ] **Pricing:** Validated with rationale
- [ ] **Positioning:** WHO/WHAT/HOW/ENEMY all clear
- [ ] **90-day Roadmap:** Month-by-month plan
- [ ] **Customer Validation:** 2-5 people saying "I'd buy this"

**If ANY of these missing:** Don't move to BUILD phase yet.

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

**Mistake 1: Trying to nail everything in one session**
- Design takes 3-4 weeks for a reason
- Solution: Use 10% → 50% → 99% model

**Mistake 2: Skipping customer validation**
- Designing in isolation without real feedback
- Solution: Always validate with 5-10 real customers

**Mistake 3: Generic positioning**
- "Help entrepreneurs grow their business"
- Solution: Use verbatim customer language, quantify gaps

**Mistake 4: Pricing based on costs (not value)**
- "I need to charge $X to cover my costs"
- Solution: Price on outcome value, not your expenses

**Mistake 5: Wrong format for client**
- Using workshop for someone who needs hand-holding
- Solution: Match format to client's style
