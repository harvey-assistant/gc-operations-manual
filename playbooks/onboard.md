# ONBOARD PLAYBOOK - Kickoff Call Execution

**Use this when:** Client signed contract + paid first invoice  
**Time needed:** 60-90 minutes  
**Goal:** Set direction, build momentum, establish cadence

---

## ⚡ 5-MINUTE OVERVIEW

**The Kickoff Formula:**
1. **Rapport** (5 min) - Celebrate getting started
2. **Set Expectations** (10 min) - Partnership model, how we work
3. **Review Intake** (15 min) - Go through their responses
4. **Define Success** (10 min) - What does winning look like?
5. **Present Direction** (25 min) - Show 10% plan, get reactions
6. **Establish Cadence** (10 min) - Weekly rhythm, next steps

**Key principle:** Give them a 10% plan to react to (not a blank page).

## 📞 DURING THE CALL: 6-STEP SEQUENCE

### STEP 1: RAPPORT & CONTEXT (5-10 min)

**Goal:** Reconnect, celebrate milestone, set excited tone

**Opening script:**
```
"So it's exciting - we're finally doing this thing! We've been talking about 
it for a while, and I'm pumped we're officially kicking things off.

I'm confident we're going to get you to [their goal]. Let's dive in."
```

**Elements to include:**
- [ ] Celebrate the milestone (they signed!)
- [ ] Express confidence ("I'm confident we'll get there")
- [ ] Quick personal check-in (light, 2-3 min max)
- [ ] Set energy level (excited, optimistic)

**Real example (Austin Cohen kickoff):**
> "Excited to finally make this official, kick things off and start day one 
> of our founder community journey."

---

### STEP 2: SET EXPECTATIONS (10 min)

**Goal:** Orient to partnership model, iterative process, how you work

**Expectation-setting script:**
```
"A few things about how we work together:

1. PARTNERSHIP MODEL
   We're thought partners with you, a growth partner. Not just execution - 
   we're here to help you see things that are hard to see when you're inside 
   the jar.

2. PROVEN MODELS
   We've worked inside tons of different thought leader businesses, so we 
   bring proven models and patterns that work.

3. ITERATIVE PROCESS
   We don't try to figure everything out on day 1. We start at 10% clarity, 
   get to 50% over a few weeks, then refine to 99%. That's how we avoid 
   overwhelm and keep momentum.

4. WHERE WE HELP
   Two main areas: Offer side (positioning, pricing, structure) and 
   Technology/Systems side (Circle, automations, operations).

Make sense?"
```

**Key phrases to use:**
- "We're thought partners with you"
- "Help you see things hard to see from inside the jar"
- "Proven models from working with tons of thought leaders"
- "Iterative clarity: 10% → 50% → 99%"

---

### STEP 3: REVIEW INTAKE FORM (15-20 min)

**Goal:** Go through responses, ask clarifying questions, capture verbatim language

**Process:**
```
1. Pull up intake form on screen (share screen)
2. Go section by section
3. Ask follow-up questions
4. Capture exact words they use
5. Note any surprises vs. discovery call
```

**Key sections to review:**

**Business Fundamentals:**
```
□ "Walk me through your current revenue - what are the main sources?"
□ "Tell me about your team - who does what?"
□ "Audience size - email list, social following?"
```

**Community Goals:**
```
□ "Why build a community now? What's the timing?"
□ "What's the revenue target you're aiming for?"
□ "How many members would make this feel successful?"
□ "Timeline - when do you want to launch?"
```

**Current State:**
```
□ "Do you have an existing community? Where? How many?"
□ "What's working well right now?"
□ "What's not working or broken?"
```

**What to listen for:**
- [ ] Verbatim language (exact words for problems/goals)
- [ ] Key dates/events (launches, conferences)
- [ ] Resources (time, budget, team)
- [ ] Constraints (technical, timeline, capacity)

**Real example (Nicolas/AI Finance Club):**
> Nic mentioned "I want to break the million dollar mark in the next two years"
> Jordan captured exact phrase for use in positioning later

---

### STEP 4: DEFINE SUCCESS CRITERIA (10 min)

**Goal:** Crystal clear on what "winning" looks like

**Success questions:**
```
□ "What would make this a massive success 6 months from now?"
□ "What are the top 3 priorities you want us to tackle first?"
□ "What would you be celebrating if everything went perfectly?"
□ "What metrics matter most to you?"
□ "What would make you feel like this was worth the investment?"
```

**Capture:**
- [ ] North Star goal (big picture)
- [ ] Key dates/events (launches, conferences, milestones)
- [ ] Revenue targets (monthly/annual)
- [ ] Member/engagement goals
- [ ] Personal wins (time freedom, impact, etc.)

**Real example (Austin Cohen):**
> North Star: Launch premium founder community by Growth Summit (Feb 5)
> Key event: 75 chiropractors attending - major sales opportunity
> Timeline anchor: 3 months to build and launch

---

### STEP 5: PRESENT INITIAL DIRECTION (20-30 min)

**Goal:** Show you've already been thinking, give them something to react to

**The "10% Plan" Approach:**
```
"Okay, so I've already been thinking about your situation, and I want to 
give you some initial ideas to react to. This is maybe 10% baked - we're 
going to refine this a ton over the next few weeks.

But I find it's way easier for you to react and say 'yes, that' or 'no, not 
that' than to start from a blank page. So let me show you what I'm thinking..."
```

**What to present:**

**A. Initial positioning angle:**
```
"Based on what you've told me, here's how I'm thinking about positioning:

WHO: [Their exact target audience]
PROBLEM: [Their exact problem in customer words]
PROMISE: [What you help them achieve]
ENEMY: [What you're NOT]

Does that resonate, or am I off?"
```

**B. Quick wins you see:**
```
"Here are 3-5 quick wins I think we can hit in the first 30 days:
1. [Specific thing]
2. [Specific thing]
3. [Specific thing]"
```

**C. Rough roadmap:**
```
"Here's what I'm thinking for the next 90 days:

MONTH 1: Strategy & Design
- Week 1-2: Nail positioning and offer
- Week 3-4: Customer validation calls

MONTH 2: Build & Test
- Week 5-6: Circle setup
- Week 7-8: Content seeding

MONTH 3: Launch & Iterate
- Week 9-10: Beta launch
- Week 11-12: Iterate based on feedback

Does that timeline feel right?"
```

**D. Similar client examples:**
```
"Let me show you [similar client] - this is what we built with them."
[Share screen, show Circle space, explain approach]
"Does this feel like the right direction for you?"
```

**Key principle:**
- React and refine > blank page
- Show you understand their situation
- Make them feel like you're already working
- Permission to change everything

---

### STEP 6: ESTABLISH CADENCE & NEXT STEPS (5-10 min)

**Goal:** Set rhythm, create momentum, book next meeting

**Cadence script:**
```
"Okay, here's how we'll work together:

WEEKLY SYNCS:
- 60-minute calls, same day/time each week
- [Propose day/time based on their availability]

COMMUNICATION:
- Slack for quick stuff (or email if they prefer)
- You'll have direct access to me, Filip, and Shannon

TEAM:
- Jordan: Strategy and big picture
- Filip: Technical implementation and operations
- Shannon: Project management and tactical execution

NEXT MEETING:
Let's book next week - [propose specific date/time]

Between now and then:
- YOU: [Specific deliverable if needed]
- US: [What we'll prepare - usually initial strategy brief]

Sound good?"
```

**What to establish:**
- [ ] Weekly sync day/time (lock it in recurring)
- [ ] Communication channel (Slack/email)
- [ ] Team roles clarified
- [ ] Next meeting booked (within 7 days)
- [ ] Clear homework/deliverables

**Typical first-month rhythm:**
```
Week 1: Kickoff (this call) → Strategy brief drafted
Week 2: Review strategy brief → 10% plan
Week 3: Deep dive on offer → 50% plan
Week 4: Customer validation → 99% plan
```

---

## 🔑 KEY FRAMEWORKS

### 1. Iterative Clarity Model (10% → 50% → 99%)

**Concept:** Don't try to figure everything out on day 1

**10% Clear (Week 1):**
- Initial direction from kickoff
- Rough ideas to react to
- Obvious quick wins identified
- Priorities set for next 2 weeks

**50% Clear (Weeks 2-3):**
- Deeper dives on offer/positioning
- Customer validation starting
- Refining based on feedback
- Clearer roadmap emerging

**99% Clear (Weeks 4-6):**
- Customer research complete
- Final offer locked in
- Detailed 90-day plan
- Confidence to execute

**Why this works:**
- Reduces overwhelm
- Creates fast momentum
- Allows course correction
- Builds confidence through iteration

**Script to explain:**
```
"We're not going to try to nail everything today. We start at 10% clarity - 
enough to move forward. Then we get to 50% over a few weeks. Then we refine 
to 99% before we execute. That way we're never stuck, never overwhelmed, and 
we can course-correct as we learn."
```

---

### 2. React and Refine (Not Blank Page)

**Concept:** Give them something to react to, don't start from scratch

**Why this works:**
- Faster decision-making
- Shows you're already thinking
- Reduces decision fatigue
- Demonstrates expertise

**Script:**
```
"I've taken some liberties here and come with ideas. You might hate all of 
it - that's totally fine. It's way easier for us to edit and refine than to 
start from a blank page. So react honestly - tell me what resonates and what 
doesn't."
```

---

### 3. Type 1 vs Type 2 Path

**Type 1 (Optimize & Grow):**
- They have existing community
- Start with AUDIT phase
- Focus: Fix what's broken, scale what works
- Examples: Realize, AI Finance Club

**Type 2 (Build from Scratch):**
- Starting new community
- Start with DESIGN phase
- Focus: Positioning, offer, pricing
- Examples: Austin Cohen, Anne-Laure

**Kickoff differences:**

| Aspect | Type 1 (Optimize) | Type 2 (Build) |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| **First priority** | Audit current state | Design offer |
| **Week 1 focus** | What's working/broken | Who/what/how much |
| **Quick wins** | Fix friction points | Validate positioning |
| **Timeline** | Faster (existing base) | Slower (building from zero) |
