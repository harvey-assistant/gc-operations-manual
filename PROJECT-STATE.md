# MASTER OPERATIONS MANUAL - PROJECT STATE
**AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE - READ THIS TO RESUME WORK**

**Last updated:** 2026-02-07 18:25 CST  
**Status:** 85% COMPLETE - Phase 4A done (co-pilot infrastructure built), Phase 4B next (deployment)  
**Deadline:** 2026-02-21 (13 days remaining)

---

## 🎯 THE MISSION

**Goal:** Extract Jordan's intuitive wisdom and operational knowledge into usable toolkits and playbooks that enable Filip and Shannon to run GrowthCommunity autonomously during Jordan's 4-week paternity leave (late February 2026).

**Why this matters:**
- Jordan's baby is due end of February 2026
- He plans to take 4 weeks completely off
- Current team says they "know what to do" but Jordan isn't confident
- This manual is the forcing function to systematize EVERYTHING

**Core challenge:**
Jordan operates on intuition and experience. The team doesn't have that. We need to extract his wisdom from real client work (transcripts) and make it teachable, repeatable, and immediately usable.

---

## 📊 CURRENT STATUS: 85% COMPLETE

**MAJOR UPDATE:** Jordan proposed pivoting from static playbooks to an interactive Operations Co-Pilot (AI assistant) that makes team members "genius superstars in seconds." Phase 4A complete - full co-pilot infrastructure built and ready to deploy.

### ✅ PHASE 1: Map Reality (Days 1-3) - COMPLETE

**Deliverable:** SYSTEM-MAP-v1.md

**What we did:**
- Analyzed 69 goldmine transcripts across 6 core clients
- Identified TWO distinct customer types:
  - **Type 1: Optimize & Grow** - Already running, start with audit (Realize, Nic/AI Finance Club, Eric Basmajian)
  - **Type 2: Build from Scratch** - New program, design → build → launch (Austin Cohen, Luca Rossi, Anne-Laure)
- Mapped 8-phase journey: Sales → Onboard → Audit → Design → Build → Launch → Optimize → Grow

**Key insight:** One-size-fits-all doesn't work. Type 1 vs Type 2 need different approaches.

---

### ✅ PHASE 2: Extract Truth (Days 4-7) - COMPLETE

**Deliverables:** 6 complete toolkits (134KB total)

#### 1. SALES-TOOLKIT.md (26KB)
**Source:** Discovery calls from all 6 clients  
**Clients:** Jake/Realize, Luca/Refactoring, Nic/AI Finance Club, Austin Cohen, Anne-Laure/Ness Labs, Eric Basmajian

**Key frameworks extracted:**
- **"Opera Singer Breaking Glass"** - Use exact customer words for visceral reaction
- **Problems-First** - Identify problem → who → solution → idea (reverse of natural order)
- **Enemy Positioning** - Define what you're NOT as important as what you ARE
- **6-step discovery sequence:**
  1. Their problem (in their words)
  2. Who specifically (audience clarity)
  3. Current solution gaps
  4. Desired outcome
  5. Constraints/timeline
  6. Next steps (clear commitment)

**Real examples:** All 6 clients' discovery call patterns documented with verbatim language

---

#### 2. ONBOARD-TOOLKIT.md (17KB)
**Source:** Kickoff sessions from all 6 clients  
**Clients:** Same 6 clients

**Key frameworks extracted:**
- **Iterative clarity model:** 10% → 50% → 99% over 3-4 weeks
- **7-step kickoff sequence:**
  1. Vision alignment (why this, why now)
  2. Audience clarity (who, not demographics)
  3. Problem definition (their language)
  4. Current state assessment
  5. Success metrics (what winning looks like)
  6. Timeline & milestones
  7. Team roles & communication

**Key insight:** Don't try to nail everything in first call. Start at 10% clarity, iterate to 50%, then refine to 99%.

---

#### 3. DESIGN-TOOLKIT.md (30KB)
**Source:** 3 design sessions + Jake Wysocki methodology  
**Sessions:** Austin Cohen (Nov 7), Luca Rossi (Feb 4 - Filip-led), Anne-Laure (Jan 20)

**Key frameworks extracted:**
- **Jake Wysocki's design thinking approach:**
  - Empathy mapping: SAY → THINK → FEEL → DO
  - "Brain on speakerphone" - make thinking visible
  - Promise statement refinement
  - Design thinking vs strategy brief
  
- **Pricing methodology:**
  - Outcome-based pricing (not feature-based)
  - Stair-step approach (start lower, increase 10% per cohort)
  - Founding member pricing strategy
  - When to test vs when to commit

- **Three session formats identified:**
  1. **Iterative** (Austin) - Multiple short sessions, building clarity
  2. **Structured Workshop** (Luca) - 90-min intensive with frameworks
  3. **Strategy Brief** (Anne-Laure) - Solo prep → async review → refinement

**Key insight:** Design thinking (empathy-first) works better than strategy consulting (solution-first) for community building.

---

#### 4. BUILD-TOOLKIT.md (19KB)
**Source:** Realize + Austin build sessions  
**Key dates:** Realize build (May-Aug 2025), Austin build (Nov-Dec 2025)

**CRITICAL FRAMEWORKS EXTRACTED:**

**Pre-sell methodology (Jordan's "secret sauce"):**
1. **Reach out** to 5-10 ideal members
2. **Sell on outcome** (not features) - have real conversations
3. **Get money** + hear objections
4. **Build based on feedback** - not your assumptions

**Why this works:**
- Validates demand before building
- Surfaces real objections early
- Builds with customers, not for them
- Faster to revenue

**Serve calls > landing pages:**
> "You sell 100x better on a serve call than any sales page" - Jordan

**Work happens ON calls (not homework):**
- 15 minutes teaching
- 75 minutes doing work together
- Immediate help when stuck
- Tangible progress each session

**Minimal viable build checklist:**
- Simple payment setup (Circle paywall link)
- Don't overthink names/categories
- Seed enough content to feel alive
- Launch when "good enough" not "perfect"

---

#### 5. LAUNCH-TOOLKIT.md (11KB)
**Source:** Realize launch (Aug 14-22, 2025)  
**Full team involved:** Jordan, Filip, Shannon, Jake, Jason

**Key frameworks extracted:**

**Gated onboarding approach:**
- Member joins → Sees ONLY onboarding course
- 10-15 minute completion unlocks full community
- Forces critical steps (profile, welcome, schedule call)
- Ensures proper orientation

**Calendly → Circle automation:**
- Problem: Members click "next, next, next" without scheduling call
- Solution: Calendly event → Make.com → Hidden tag in Circle
- Result: Can filter/message members who haven't scheduled
- Follow-up: Day 3 DM if no tag, Day 7 personal outreach

**Squad/pod placement automation:**
- Profile-based auto-assignment (no manual bottleneck)
- Make.com checks profile answers → assigns to correct squad
- Scales infinitely, no community manager needed

**Recycling spaces (not creating new ones):**
- Every 6 months, pod cohorts end
- Don't create new spaces (clutter)
- Clear old space → Remove members → Add new cohort
- Keeps Circle clean and navigable

**Balance momentum vs friction:**
> "Don't make them wait till Monday if they're fired up Saturday night" - Jordan

**Key principle:** Quick unlock (10-15 min) that still captures critical data.

---

#### 6. OPTIMIZE-TOOLKIT.md (11KB)
**Source:** Realize weekly syncs (Jan 28, 2026)  
**Team:** Jordan, Filip, Shannon, Jake

**Key frameworks extracted:**

**Weekly sync structure (30-45 min):**
1. Action items review (5 min) - What got done?
2. Metrics check (5 min) - Growth, engagement, churn
3. Issues & blockers (15 min) - What's broken?
4. Prioritization (10 min) - What's most important this week?
5. Wins & next steps (5 min) - Celebrate + focus

**Churn management:**
- Two cancellation paths: Managed (with survey) vs Direct (bypass)
- Don't force survey, make it easy to find
- Accept not everyone fills it out
- Enable self-cancellation (don't make people ask permission)

**Exit survey best practices:**
- Why leaving? (Multiple choice + other)
- What would have made you stay? (Free text)
- NPS score (0-10)
- Can we follow up? (Email for win-back)

**Automation maintenance:**
- Monitor → Report → Fix → Verify
- Manual workarounds while investigating root cause
- Weekly automation health check
- Document profile → squad mapping

**Team scaling triggers:**
- Hire when bottleneck is documented and proven
- Realize example: Pod coordinator hired when Jake spending 10+ hours/week on placements
- Next hire: Dedicated facilitators (not busy firm owners)

**Key principle:** Short weekly syncs + manual workarounds + continuous iteration

---

---

## 🔑 KEY DECISIONS & PRINCIPLES

**Format decisions:**
1. **Use real client names** (not anonymized) - More powerful for reference
2. **Verbatim language captured** - "Break the million dollar mark" > generic summaries
3. **Decision trees + checklists + scripts** - Three formats for different learning styles
4. **HTML viewers for browser viewing** - Not raw .md files (learned this lesson)

**Methodological principles:**
1. **Extract from transcripts, not theory** - What Jordan actually does > what he thinks he does
2. **Two customer types matter** - Type 1 (Optimize) vs Type 2 (Build) need different approaches
3. **Iterative clarity is key** - Don't nail everything in first call (10% → 50% → 99%)
4. **Pre-sell before build** - Reach out → Sell → Build (not Build → Sell → Launch)
5. **Balance momentum vs friction** - Quick unlock but still capture critical data

**Operational principles:**
1. **Weekly syncs should be short** - 30-45 min, focused on action
2. **Manual workarounds are OK** - While investigating root cause
3. **Hire after bottleneck is proven** - Document role first
4. **Scale what works, kill what doesn't** - One big experiment per week
